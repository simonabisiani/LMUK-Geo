It's a charming Grade II-listed inn, the oldest in the coastal village, its only freehouse and is renowned around the world by yachtsmen. ALSO READ: The tiny Hampshire micropub with space for just 25 drinkers Popular with locals, sailors and visitors, The Bugle enjoys a terrace overlooking the River Hamble, exposed wooden beams, cosy fires and The Captain's Table, a private dining room which can host up to ten diners for special celebrations or meetings. Pub classics like burger and fish and chips sit on the menu alongside more modern dishes like Crispy Ponzu Chicken and Pork Belly. Rums, craft ales, cocktails and barista coffee are a hit with the punters. Bugle Ale and Espresso Martinis being particular favourites. Dogs are welcome and are regular visitors to the pub, which is perfectly placed for walks along the river, through the village and along the Solent Way. General manager Ana Rodriguez told the Daily Echo: ""We love being so close to the water and embrace the fact that the pub has always related to sailors and boats. ""The service and friendliness of those who work here is special. We love what we do and we believe service and atmosphere make a real difference. We love to build a relationship with the locals and our regular customers, as well as all those who visit us on holiday, whether for the first time or every time they come back. ""We try to create an informal casual dining experience without losing the essence of the pub, its building and history."" The Bugle certainly boasts a rich history. The first mention of the property was at a Winchester College Court in 1656, but archaeological finds suggest that the original building has been around for decades longer. At the beginning of the 1800s, the pub was called The Bull and later The Ferry House. Auctions and inquests were held there, it even featured in a court case itself when the landlord at the time was convicted of permitting drunkenness of invalid soldiers from Netley Hospital. All kinds of mariners were regular lodgers and a fascinating visitor’s book from 1895 to 1906 still exists which contains drawings, jokes and reviews from the yachting fraternity. The Hamble River Sailing Club was actually founded at The Bugle back in 1919 and the grounds were used to start races. The pub still sponsors the Hamble Winter Races and hosts the club's awards ceremonies.

mistral,0,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane as the address of the accused."

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games.

mistral,0,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence.

Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,The article mentions Glasgow as the location where Rangers' annual general meeting took place at the Clyde Auditorium.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made.",the Whalley War Memorial,burnleyexpress.net,Burnley,NA,Ribble Valley,,Whalley,The article mentions Whalley War Memorial and the service of remembrance held there.
mistral,0,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,0,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

mistral,0,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

mistral,0,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Each area within the site will have different character areas. For example, the northern part of the golf course site ‘is likely to be’ predominantly apartments, which could be between four to six-storeys in height.",South West Maidenhead,sloughobserver.co.uk,Slough,NA,Windsor and Maidenhead,,Windsor and Maidenhead,"The article mentions South West Maidenhead, which is a part of Windsor and Maidenhead district."

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

The open day will take place on October 7 from 10am until 4pm.

mistral,0,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

mistral,0,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

They say that maintaining sovereign capability in nuclear fuel manufacture was essential for achieving net zero. The statement says: “We are increasingly concerned that the current ownership model is becoming a potential obstacle to preserving the site and the jobs that depend on it. “Westinghouse, the current owners, have so far failed to provide cast-iron guarantees on the future of fuel manufacturing at the site and have failed to bring in additional work either from their own reactors abroad or to fuel the reactors of their competitors. “Unless this situation changes, we believe that the government should consider an alternative ownership structure that will maximise the possibility of protecting the site and maintaining this vital sovereign capability.” The Uranium Oxide plant at Springfields The unions point to the National Nuclear Laboratory and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as potential owners.

gemma2:latest,0,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article states that Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done."

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

gemma2:latest,0,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow City,"The article states that the Clyde Auditorium is where Rangers' annual general meeting took place and mentions 'Govan club', which is a district within Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

gemma2:latest,0,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

gemma2:latest,0,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Each area within the site will have different character areas.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bath and North East Somerset,The article states that the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor would connect the A4 to the A37 and mentions concerns from campaigners in Bath and North East Somerset.

Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.

gemma2:latest,0,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

The Prospect and Untie unions have been campaigning to retain skilled jobs at the site which are under pressure as only one new nuclear power station is being built despite the fact that the old power stations are coming to the end of their life. Fylde MP Mark Menzies recently lobbied the energy minister about the future of nuclear skills and jobs and was told an announcement is in the pipeline. The huge nuclear fuel factory at Springfields between Preston and Blackpool But unions feel it may be too late as by the time power stations are built UK skilled jobs will have long gone. They say that maintaining sovereign capability in nuclear fuel manufacture was essential for achieving net zero. The statement says: “We are increasingly concerned that the current ownership model is becoming a potential obstacle to preserving the site and the jobs that depend on it. “Westinghouse, the current owners, have so far failed to provide cast-iron guarantees on the future of fuel manufacturing at the site and have failed to bring in additional work either from their own reactors abroad or to fuel the reactors of their competitors. “Unless this situation changes, we believe that the government should consider an alternative ownership structure that will maximise the possibility of protecting the site and maintaining this vital sovereign capability.” The Uranium Oxide plant at Springfields The unions point to the National Nuclear Laboratory and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as potential owners. A Westinghouse spokesman said: “Westinghouse is committed to the UK and we are working with our partners to secure the long term future of nuclear fuel manufacturing at Springfields.” A department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Nuclear power has a key role to play in the UK’s low-carbon energy future and we intend to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next three years in order to strengthen our energy security, and create thousands of jobs across the country. “We recognise how important it is that we can manufacture fuel here in the UK and maintain a skilled workforce in the sector.",Fylde,blackpoolgazette.co.uk,Blackpool,Fylde,Fylde,,Fylde,"The article mentions Fylde MP Mark Menzies and that the Springfields factory is located between Preston and Blackpool, which suggests it is situated in the Fylde area."

Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, as the address of Bernadette O'Loughlin."

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

llama3.1:latest,0,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects.

After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

llama3.1:latest,0,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

llama3.1:latest,0,"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

llama3.1:latest,0,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

llama3.1:latest,0,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”

llama3.1:latest,0,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin.

The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Co Tyrone,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone as the location of the defendant's residence."

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort.""

A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald.

The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

""I objected to this application on the grounds of its encroachment on the greenbelt, traffic congestion and air quality.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

qwen2:7b-instruct,0,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.

“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",South Bristol Wrong Road,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,South Bristol,The article mentions South Bristol and its specific road Wrong Road.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane as the address of the accused."

Naomi said: ""It is very important to teach children first aid. ""You do see in papers from time to time that children from as young as three do actually ring 999 and get help so it is really important."" In these classes, students were taught how to use ice packs on bumps, how to put plasters on and how to call 999 and what to say. Naomi continued: ""I take a giant teddy along and we do wet bleeds, and use toy phones to practice calling 999, and we have a song which helps them remember the number, and we talk about the importance of knowing where they live. ""We also cover real basics of the recovery position but in a way that isn't scary. ""Obviously at that age, we don't want to go too far and scare the kids, but the way we teach the recovery position is a really fun way and the kids really enjoy it and the amount of information they retain is amazing.""

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games.

mistral,0.25,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Julie’s daughter and Harry’s mother, Hayley Charlesworth, founded the charity in his name to provide other families with much-needed emotional and practical support. “As a society we don’t do enough to support those who provide care and those who need it, and that’s something I’m passionate about changing,” said Julie. “We are so grateful to Kelham for volunteering to help us raise money and spread the message about the work of Harry’s Pals.” To sponsor Kelham go to Kelham Cooke is fundraising for Harry’s Pals (justgiving.com) More information about the charity is available at https://www.harryspals.co.uk",Sibson Airfield,thelincolnite.co.uk,Lincoln,NA,Peterborough,,Peterborough,The article mentions that Kelham will make his tandem skydive at Sibson Airfield in Peterborough.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,The article mentions Glasgow as the location where Rangers' annual general meeting took place at the Clyde Auditorium.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe.

After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

mistral,0.25,"Easier access to your trusted, local news. Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,0.25,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

“Shortly before 6pm, approximately around 20 people had gathered at the event which was peaceful. This number quickly grew to approximately 100.

""As a result, officers engaged with the event organisers and explained and encouraged people to comply with the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020. Subsequently, five people were issued with Fixed Penalty Notices under the Health Protection Regulations.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

“Shortly before 6pm, approximately around 20 people had gathered at the event which was peaceful. This number quickly grew to approximately 100.

""As a result, officers engaged with the event organisers and explained and encouraged people to comply with the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020. Subsequently, five people were issued with Fixed Penalty Notices under the Health Protection Regulations.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

There are open evenings on November 1 & 2 at the main Barnstaple campus and the team would love to chat about sport with anyone considering a course at Petroc.",Richard Huish 1sts,northdevongazette.co.uk,North Devon,NA,Somerset,,Taunton,"The article mentions Richard Huish 1sts, which implies that the entity (Richard Huish) is located in Taunton."
mistral,0.25,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",Sloemans Farm,enfielddispatch.co.uk,Enfield,NA,Enfield,,Enfield,The article mentions Hertford Road Cemetery which is located in Enfield and the domain enfielddispatch.co.uk indicates that the article is published by a local news source for Enfield.

mistral,0.25,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

mistral,0.25,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

mistral,0.25,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it.

gemma2:latest,0.25,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article states that Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done."

gemma2:latest,0.25,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine. The jury retired to consider its verdict on Monday afternoon (November 14) and is expected to continue its deliberations on Tuesday (November 15).",Long Melford,eadt.co.uk,Peterborough,Babergh,Babergh,,Babergh,"The article mentions Long Melford and its proximity to Sudbury, which are both within Babergh district."
gemma2:latest,0.25,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. – The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort.""

A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross.

gemma2:latest,0.25,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

The statement says: “We are increasingly concerned that the current ownership model is becoming a potential obstacle to preserving the site and the jobs that depend on it. “Westinghouse, the current owners, have so far failed to provide cast-iron guarantees on the future of fuel manufacturing at the site and have failed to bring in additional work either from their own reactors abroad or to fuel the reactors of their competitors. “Unless this situation changes, we believe that the government should consider an alternative ownership structure that will maximise the possibility of protecting the site and maintaining this vital sovereign capability.” The Uranium Oxide plant at Springfields The unions point to the National Nuclear Laboratory and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as potential owners. A Westinghouse spokesman said: “Westinghouse is committed to the UK and we are working with our partners to secure the long term future of nuclear fuel manufacturing at Springfields.” A department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Nuclear power has a key role to play in the UK’s low-carbon energy future and we intend to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next three years in order to strengthen our energy security, and create thousands of jobs across the country. “We recognise how important it is that we can manufacture fuel here in the UK and maintain a skilled workforce in the sector.",Springfields,blackpoolgazette.co.uk,Blackpool,LAD not in options,Fylde,,Preston,The article states that Springfields is located between Preston and Blackpool.
gemma2:latest,0.25,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine. The jury retired to consider its verdict on Monday afternoon (November 14) and is expected to continue its deliberations on Tuesday (November 15).",the A134 and Springlands Avenue,eadt.co.uk,Peterborough,NA,Babergh,,Babergh,"The article mentions Long Melford and Sudbury, both towns within Babergh District."

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence.

gemma2:latest,0.25,"The former Charlton man is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Ibrox and could look to return south when it expires. The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow City,"The article states that the Clyde Auditorium is where Rangers' annual general meeting took place and mentions 'Govan club', which is a district within Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

gemma2:latest,0.25,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

There are open evenings on November 1 & 2 at the main Barnstaple campus and the team would love to chat about sport with anyone considering a course at Petroc.",Richard Huish 1sts,northdevongazette.co.uk,North Devon,NA,Somerset,,Taunton,The article mentions Petroc travelling to Taunton to play Richard Huish 1sts.
gemma2:latest,0.25,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",Sloemans Farm,enfielddispatch.co.uk,Enfield,NA,Enfield,,Enfield,The article states that Sloemans Farm is located within Enfield and discusses plans for a cemetery there.

gemma2:latest,0.25,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

Leighton Buzzard South, which a week ago was top of the list, is next with 57. That's down from 74 the previous week. The only other wards to see a drop were Dunstable-Watling 46 (previously 54), Dunstable-Central 19 (previously 28) and Potton 13 (previously 17).

Covid testing

All other wards saw a rise, apart from Dunstable-Icknield which was unchanged at 36 new cases.

That means over the last week, cases in Central Bedfordshire have gone up by 230 to 984 new cases (up from a rate of 261.2 to 340.9 per 100,000 people). This compares to: Bedford – 453 new cases (261.4 per 100,000) with 1 death reported; Luton – 638 new cases (299.5 per 100,000) with 1 death reported; nd Milton Keynes – 769 new cases (285.4 cases per 100,000) and no deaths reported.

The weekly reports states: ""Cases of Covid-19 have again risen significantly this week, reaching levels last seen at the end of January. The number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital care is stable and there were no deaths here in the last reporting week.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

gemma2:latest,0.25,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

gemma2:latest,0.25,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

llama3.1:latest,0.25,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions that Bernadette O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit."

Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game.

A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald.

llama3.1:latest,0.25,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Glasgow and the Clyde Auditorium, which suggests that the entity is situated within the city."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe.

After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody.

llama3.1:latest,0.25,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

llama3.1:latest,0.25,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

llama3.1:latest,0.25,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

llama3.1:latest,0.25,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

It's a charming Grade II-listed inn, the oldest in the coastal village, its only freehouse and is renowned around the world by yachtsmen. ALSO READ: The tiny Hampshire micropub with space for just 25 drinkers Popular with locals, sailors and visitors, The Bugle enjoys a terrace overlooking the River Hamble, exposed wooden beams, cosy fires and The Captain's Table, a private dining room which can host up to ten diners for special celebrations or meetings. Pub classics like burger and fish and chips sit on the menu alongside more modern dishes like Crispy Ponzu Chicken and Pork Belly. Rums, craft ales, cocktails and barista coffee are a hit with the punters. Bugle Ale and Espresso Martinis being particular favourites. Dogs are welcome and are regular visitors to the pub, which is perfectly placed for walks along the river, through the village and along the Solent Way. General manager Ana Rodriguez told the Daily Echo: ""We love being so close to the water and embrace the fact that the pub has always related to sailors and boats. ""The service and friendliness of those who work here is special. We love what we do and we believe service and atmosphere make a real difference. We love to build a relationship with the locals and our regular customers, as well as all those who visit us on holiday, whether for the first time or every time they come back. ""We try to create an informal casual dining experience without losing the essence of the pub, its building and history."" The Bugle certainly boasts a rich history. The first mention of the property was at a Winchester College Court in 1656, but archaeological finds suggest that the original building has been around for decades longer. At the beginning of the 1800s, the pub was called The Bull and later The Ferry House. Auctions and inquests were held there, it even featured in a court case itself when the landlord at the time was convicted of permitting drunkenness of invalid soldiers from Netley Hospital. All kinds of mariners were regular lodgers and a fascinating visitor’s book from 1895 to 1906 still exists which contains drawings, jokes and reviews from the yachting fraternity. The Hamble River Sailing Club was actually founded at The Bugle back in 1919 and the grounds were used to start races.

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.25,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Co Tyrone,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone as the location of the accused's residence."

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game.

The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Clyde Auditorium and Ibrox, both located in Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made.",the Whalley War Memorial,burnleyexpress.net,Burnley,NA,Ribble Valley,,Clitheroe,The article mentions Clitheroe and its local events related to the Whalley War Memorial.
qwen2:7b-instruct,0.25,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.25,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.25,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Each area within the site will have different character areas.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

The open day will take place on October 7 from 10am until 4pm.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.25,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.25,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

mistral,0.5,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane as the address of the accused."

Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,0.5,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

mistral,0.5,"The former Charlton man is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Ibrox and could look to return south when it expires. The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,The article mentions Glasgow as the location where Rangers' annual general meeting took place at the Clyde Auditorium.

mistral,0.5,"Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Somewhere on a quiet football pitch in Knutsford, Cheshire, it's a frosty December morning and Danny Simpson is training with the cold biting at his fingers. The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,0.5,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

mistral,0.5,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

The Crookston Memorial was produced by local man Mr Carrick, is composed of red sandstone and stands nearly six feet high, with two reversed rifles and a wreath of laurels engraved at the top.

In the centre, a panel bears the names and regiments of those who were killed in the Great War of 1914-18.

Following the conflict, the communities of Wallyford, Smeaton and Deantown (now Whitecraig) decided to honour the men who fell with a memorial. They chose to erect the memorial at Crookston School, between and serving all the villages. It was unveiled on September 13, 1919, by Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Hope.

More than 100 former pupils had answered the call of duty and the names of 20 of them appeared on the memorial.

When Crookston School closed in about 1958, the memorial was taken to Inveresk Cemetery.

In 2014, Wallyford Community Council secured funding from the Centenary Memorials Restoration Fund, administered by the War Memorials Trust, along with funding from East Lothian Council’s Civic Pride Fund, to have restoration work carried out on the memorial stone.",Inveresk Cemetery,eastlothiancourier.com,East Lothian,NA,East Lothian,,East Lothian,"The article mentions Wallyford Livingroom Church, St Clement’s Church in Wallyford, and Wallyford Community Council, all of which are located in East Lothian."
mistral,0.5,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Each area within the site will have different character areas.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

mistral,0.5,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

mistral,0.5,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article states that Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done."

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Somewhere on a quiet football pitch in Knutsford, Cheshire, it's a frosty December morning and Danny Simpson is training with the cold biting at his fingers. The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

He ended the campaign with Dorridge U3A and other local residents with the help of the Knowle and Dorridge Lions in Dorridge Park where volunteers found litter ranging from crisp packets to parts of a washing machine.

Mr Bhatti said: “I was thrilled to host another Keep Meriden Tidy weekend and help local groups in their endeavour to keep Meriden tidy.

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.

gemma2:latest,0.5,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions that Bernadette O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit."

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

llama3.1:latest,0.5,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody.

llama3.1:latest,0.5,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

""I objected to this application on the grounds of its encroachment on the greenbelt, traffic congestion and air quality. It was a development too far and I am pleased that the Planning Inspector dismissed the appeal by Peel Investments.”",Haydock Point,wigantoday.net,Wigan,NA,St Helens,,St Helens,"The article mentions St Helens Council and Haydock Point being rejected by them, indicating that both Parkside Colliery and Haydock Point are located within the boundaries of St Helens Local Authority District."

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

llama3.1:latest,0.5,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

llama3.1:latest,0.5,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

llama3.1:latest,0.5,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bath and North East Somerset,"The article mentions Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews and the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which suggests that the entity is situated in the area around Bristol and Bath."

The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",South Bristol Wrong Road,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bath and North East Somerset,"The article mentions South Bristol Wrong Road, which is located in Bath and North East Somerset, as well as other locations such as Saltford, Charfield, St Annes Park, Ashton Gate, Constable Road, Thornbury, Pilning, and Bristol Airport."

llama3.1:latest,0.5,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.5,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Co Tyrone,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone as the location of the defendant's residence."

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine. The jury retired to consider its verdict on Monday afternoon (November 14) and is expected to continue its deliberations on Tuesday (November 15).",Long Melford,eadt.co.uk,Peterborough,Babergh,Babergh,,Long Melford,"The article mentions Cordell Place, Long Melford as the location of Tony Constantine's residence."

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.5,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Clyde Auditorium and Ibrox, both located in Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames.

Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence.

After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.5,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

There are open evenings on November 1 & 2 at the main Barnstaple campus and the team would love to chat about sport with anyone considering a course at Petroc.",Richard Huish 1sts,northdevongazette.co.uk,North Devon,NA,Somerset,,Taunton Deane,The article mentions Petroc travelling to Taunton and playing against Richard Huish 1sts.

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.5,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

The open day will take place on October 7 from 10am until 4pm.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.5,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bath and North East Somerset,"The article discusses plans for Bath and Bristol regions, including specific locations like Bath Trams and Saltford."

The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",South Bristol Wrong Road,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,South Bristol,The article mentions South Bristol and its specific road (Wrong Road) as part of the context.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.5,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me.

mistral,0.75,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane as the address of the accused."

With funding from Ipswich Opportunity Area, 53 primary schools, nurseries and preschools across Ipswich will benefit from the training. Children at Highfield - Whitehouse Early Years benefitted from this training most recently, from one of the first aiders Naomi Cooper, and 'Big Ted'. Naomi said: ""It is very important to teach children first aid. ""You do see in papers from time to time that children from as young as three do actually ring 999 and get help so it is really important."" In these classes, students were taught how to use ice packs on bumps, how to put plasters on and how to call 999 and what to say. Naomi continued: ""I take a giant teddy along and we do wet bleeds, and use toy phones to practice calling 999, and we have a song which helps them remember the number, and we talk about the importance of knowing where they live. ""We also cover real basics of the recovery position but in a way that isn't scary. ""Obviously at that age, we don't want to go too far and scare the kids, but the way we teach the recovery position is a really fun way and the kids really enjoy it and the amount of information they retain is amazing."" Since September 2020, first aid training has been part of the national curriculum, which is being fulfilled by Mini First Aid.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross.

The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games.

mistral,0.75,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

mistral,0.75,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,The article mentions Glasgow as the location where Rangers' annual general meeting took place at the Clyde Auditorium.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

mistral,0.75,"Easier access to your trusted, local news. Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,0.75,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",Sloemans Farm,enfielddispatch.co.uk,Enfield,NA,Enfield,,Enfield,The article mentions Hertford Road Cemetery which is located in Enfield and the domain enfielddispatch.co.uk indicates that the article is published by a local news source for Enfield.

mistral,0.75,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

mistral,0.75,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

mistral,0.75,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.

mistral,0.75,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

It's a charming Grade II-listed inn, the oldest in the coastal village, its only freehouse and is renowned around the world by yachtsmen. ALSO READ: The tiny Hampshire micropub with space for just 25 drinkers Popular with locals, sailors and visitors, The Bugle enjoys a terrace overlooking the River Hamble, exposed wooden beams, cosy fires and The Captain's Table, a private dining room which can host up to ten diners for special celebrations or meetings.

Dogs are welcome and are regular visitors to the pub, which is perfectly placed for walks along the river, through the village and along the Solent Way. General manager Ana Rodriguez told the Daily Echo: ""We love being so close to the water and embrace the fact that the pub has always related to sailors and boats. ""The service and friendliness of those who work here is special. We love what we do and we believe service and atmosphere make a real difference. We love to build a relationship with the locals and our regular customers, as well as all those who visit us on holiday, whether for the first time or every time they come back. ""We try to create an informal casual dining experience without losing the essence of the pub, its building and history."" The Bugle certainly boasts a rich history.

All kinds of mariners were regular lodgers and a fascinating visitor’s book from 1895 to 1906 still exists which contains drawings, jokes and reviews from the yachting fraternity. The Hamble River Sailing Club was actually founded at The Bugle back in 1919 and the grounds were used to start races.

gemma2:latest,0.75,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article states that Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done."

gemma2:latest,0.75,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game.

gemma2:latest,0.75,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow City,"The article states that the Clyde Auditorium is where Rangers' annual general meeting took place and mentions 'Govan club', which is a district within Glasgow."

gemma2:latest,0.75,"Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Somewhere on a quiet football pitch in Knutsford, Cheshire, it's a frosty December morning and Danny Simpson is training with the cold biting at his fingers. The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around.

The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

gemma2:latest,0.75,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

gemma2:latest,0.75,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",Sloemans Farm,enfielddispatch.co.uk,Enfield,NA,Enfield,,Enfield,The article states that Sloemans Farm is located within Enfield and discusses plans for a cemetery on the site.

gemma2:latest,0.75,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

gemma2:latest,0.75,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

gemma2:latest,0.75,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Pub classics like burger and fish and chips sit on the menu alongside more modern dishes like Crispy Ponzu Chicken and Pork Belly. Rums, craft ales, cocktails and barista coffee are a hit with the punters. Bugle Ale and Espresso Martinis being particular favourites. Dogs are welcome and are regular visitors to the pub, which is perfectly placed for walks along the river, through the village and along the Solent Way. General manager Ana Rodriguez told the Daily Echo: ""We love being so close to the water and embrace the fact that the pub has always related to sailors and boats. ""The service and friendliness of those who work here is special. We love what we do and we believe service and atmosphere make a real difference. We love to build a relationship with the locals and our regular customers, as well as all those who visit us on holiday, whether for the first time or every time they come back. ""We try to create an informal casual dining experience without losing the essence of the pub, its building and history."" The Bugle certainly boasts a rich history. The first mention of the property was at a Winchester College Court in 1656, but archaeological finds suggest that the original building has been around for decades longer. At the beginning of the 1800s, the pub was called The Bull and later The Ferry House. Auctions and inquests were held there, it even featured in a court case itself when the landlord at the time was convicted of permitting drunkenness of invalid soldiers from Netley Hospital. All kinds of mariners were regular lodgers and a fascinating visitor’s book from 1895 to 1906 still exists which contains drawings, jokes and reviews from the yachting fraternity. The Hamble River Sailing Club was actually founded at The Bugle back in 1919 and the grounds were used to start races.

llama3.1:latest,0.75,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser.

Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position.

llama3.1:latest,0.75,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Glasgow and Ibrox, which suggests that the Clyde Auditorium is located within the city."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made.",the Whalley War Memorial,burnleyexpress.net,Burnley,NA,Ribble Valley,,Hyndburn,"The article mentions Clitheroe and Whalley, which are both located within the Hyndburn Local Authority District in Lancashire."
llama3.1:latest,0.75,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody.

llama3.1:latest,0.75,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

llama3.1:latest,0.75,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Each area within the site will have different character areas.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

The open day will take place on October 7 from 10am until 4pm.

llama3.1:latest,0.75,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

llama3.1:latest,0.75,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Co Tyrone,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone as the location of the defendant's residence."

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out.

Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"The former Charlton man is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Ibrox and could look to return south when it expires. The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Clyde Auditorium and Ibrox, both located in Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence.

Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho.

The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Each area within the site will have different character areas.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

READ MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

qwen2:7b-instruct,0.75,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

mistral,1,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane as the address of the accused."

Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,1,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

More than 38,000 people signed an online petition demanding theatres cancel the production created by performance company This Egg. It stated: ""Children should not be desensitised to the sight of naked adult bodies or introduced to topics surrounding adult sexual pleasure which this production promotes and celebrates."" A banner for The Family Sex Show (Image: This Egg) A spokeswoman for the Norfolk and Norwich Festival has since confirmed the show has been cancelled from all venues. She said: ""The decision has been taken to cancel the performances of This Egg’s The Family Sex Show at The Garage, as part of Norfolk and Norwich Festival. ""In recent days there has been unacceptable threat and abuse directed at both the company and the venues hosting the tour by a small minority, and in order to ensure the safety of the performers, staff and audiences, the show will no longer play at this time at The Garage, as part of Norfolk and Norwich Festival.

mistral,1,"Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free Somewhere on a quiet football pitch in Knutsford, Cheshire, it's a frosty December morning and Danny Simpson is training with the cold biting at his fingers. The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe.

Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

mistral,1,"Easier access to your trusted, local news. Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

mistral,1,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

mistral,1,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

READ MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

mistral,1,"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

mistral,1,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bristol,The article mentions South Bristol and other locations within Bristol.
mistral,1,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.

mistral,1,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article states that Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done."

gemma2:latest,1,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

gemma2:latest,1,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. – The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game.

The statement says: “We are increasingly concerned that the current ownership model is becoming a potential obstacle to preserving the site and the jobs that depend on it. “Westinghouse, the current owners, have so far failed to provide cast-iron guarantees on the future of fuel manufacturing at the site and have failed to bring in additional work either from their own reactors abroad or to fuel the reactors of their competitors. “Unless this situation changes, we believe that the government should consider an alternative ownership structure that will maximise the possibility of protecting the site and maintaining this vital sovereign capability.” The Uranium Oxide plant at Springfields The unions point to the National Nuclear Laboratory and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as potential owners.

The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

gemma2:latest,1,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow City,"The article states that the Clyde Auditorium is where Rangers' annual general meeting took place and mentions 'Govan club', which is a district within Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future.

Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

gemma2:latest,1,"now In Clitheroe, the Town Mayor and Mayoress, Councillors Simon and Donna O’Rourke, led tributes to the fallen on Remembrance Sunday. A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club."" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe.

gemma2:latest,1,"Easier access to your trusted, local news. Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

gemma2:latest,1,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

""I objected to this application on the grounds of its encroachment on the greenbelt, traffic congestion and air quality. It was a development too far and I am pleased that the Planning Inspector dismissed the appeal by Peel Investments.”",Haydock Point,wigantoday.net,Wigan,NA,St Helens,,St Helens,The article repeatedly mentions St Helens Council rejecting both the Haydock Point project and approving the Parkside Colliery regeneration.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

There are open evenings on November 1 & 2 at the main Barnstaple campus and the team would love to chat about sport with anyone considering a course at Petroc.",Richard Huish 1sts,northdevongazette.co.uk,North Devon,NA,Somerset,,Taunton,The article mentions Petroc travelling to Taunton to play Richard Huish 1sts.
gemma2:latest,1,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

gemma2:latest,1,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

gemma2:latest,1,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bath and North East Somerset,The article states that the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor would connect the A4 to the A37 and mentions concerns from campaigners in Bath and North East Somerset.

Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",South Bristol Wrong Road,bristolpost.co.uk,"Bristol, City of",NA,"Bristol, City of",,Bath and North East Somerset,The article mentions South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker who objects to the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor which would connect the A4 to the A37 in Bath and North East Somerset.

gemma2:latest,1,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out.

llama3.1:latest,1,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Strabane,"The article mentions that Bernadette O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit."

With funding from Ipswich Opportunity Area, 53 primary schools, nurseries and preschools across Ipswich will benefit from the training. Children at Highfield - Whitehouse Early Years benefitted from this training most recently, from one of the first aiders Naomi Cooper, and 'Big Ted'. Naomi said: ""It is very important to teach children first aid. ""You do see in papers from time to time that children from as young as three do actually ring 999 and get help so it is really important."" In these classes, students were taught how to use ice packs on bumps, how to put plasters on and how to call 999 and what to say. Naomi continued: ""I take a giant teddy along and we do wet bleeds, and use toy phones to practice calling 999, and we have a song which helps them remember the number, and we talk about the importance of knowing where they live. ""We also cover real basics of the recovery position but in a way that isn't scary. ""Obviously at that age, we don't want to go too far and scare the kids, but the way we teach the recovery position is a really fun way and the kids really enjoy it and the amount of information they retain is amazing."" Since September 2020, first aid training has been part of the national curriculum, which is being fulfilled by Mini First Aid.

llama3.1:latest,1,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser.

llama3.1:latest,1,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

llama3.1:latest,1,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Glasgow and the Clyde Auditorium, which suggests that the entity is situated within the city."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence.

After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial.

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody.

llama3.1:latest,1,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

“Shortly before 6pm, approximately around 20 people had gathered at the event which was peaceful. This number quickly grew to approximately 100.

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

llama3.1:latest,1,"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",Sloemans Farm,enfielddispatch.co.uk,Enfield,NA,Enfield,,Enfield,"The article mentions Enfield's Green Belt and Hertford Road Cemetery as existing graveyards in Enfield, indicating that Sloemans Farm is located within the borough of Enfield."

llama3.1:latest,1,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

llama3.1:latest,1,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

llama3.1:latest,1,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer.

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",Greeve Park,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast,NA,Derry and Strabane,,Co Tyrone,"The article mentions Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone as the location of the defendant's residence."

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort.""

A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage.

The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Before Ipswich Crown Court is Tony Constantine, 37, of Cordell Place, Long Melford who has pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 17 last year. Giving evidence during his trial Constantine claimed the alleged victim has been armed with a hammer and had swung it at him. “I was fearful for my life if I got hit over the head with a hammer,” said Constantin. The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer. Matthew Bagnall, prosecuting, has claimed that Constantine had gone over to the alleged victim’s van without waiting for him to get out and attacked him. He claimed that Constantine held the man in the van and bit his nose causing a “significant” crescent-shaped wound. He said Constantine claimed that the alleged victim had a hammer and that he only bit his nose in order to defend himself from being attacked with the hammer. Mr Bagnall said it wasn’t disputed that there was a hammer in the van and the issue was at what stage the alleged victim had taken hold of it. During his evidence, the alleged victim of the attack denied he had been intent on using serious violence against Constantine.

The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window.

He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",the Clyde Auditorium,glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,NA,Glasgow City,,Glasgow,"The article mentions Clyde Auditorium and Ibrox, both located in Glasgow."

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around.

The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer.

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years.

This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.""

FORRES Mechanics manager Gordon Connelly has said there are ""so many pluses"" after his side's 1-0 defeat against Formartine United. After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. ""We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game.

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",Sloemans Farm,enfielddispatch.co.uk,Enfield,NA,Enfield,,Enfield,"The article discusses plans for a cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road, which is located in Enfield, as mentioned in the context and confirmed by the council's decision-making process."

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

READ MORE: South West Maidenhead: Plans could be submitted this year

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

The 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

Existing bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.

This critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.

Elsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.

qwen2:7b-instruct,1,"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”
