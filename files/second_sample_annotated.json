The Independent run City Council has made many representations to the Conservative run County Council over the matter.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that while some laybys in Wensleydale have been resurfaced there are still potholes in the centre of town. It’s also been made clear that the Highway Maintenance Government Grant has been cut by £4m, which is not helping.\n\n[tptn_list limit=3 daily=1 hour_range=1]\n\nCouncil Leader Andrew Williams had written to Mr Battersby requesting that either he or the Cabinet Member or indeed both attend a meeting of Ripon City Council which, said Cllr Williams, is a public meeting and open to scrutiny by everyone.\n\nHe said it was agreed it could be a virtual meeting but that should be open to the media to watch. Cllr Williams said he thought that the public needed to hear the explanations of NYCC on this matter.\n\nMr Battersby said he did not want the media in attendance saying it was a discussion between “ourselves” and not a public meeting.\n\nCllr Williams told YorkMix that Mr Battersby asked that the meeting could be done over the internet as many meetings have been done since covid. But the law prevents formal council meetings being done online now so this had to be an informal meeting.\n\n“We still wanted the media to be present as they would be if the meeting was held in person at the council.\n\n“The Director refuseds to allow you (media) access despite my best efforts. He wishes to remain in his ivory tower and avoid public scrutiny which I think is unacceptable.”\n\nUpdate\n\nThe meeting went ahead without the media and Cllr Andrew Williams Leader Ripon City Council, issued a statement saying: “I am confused as to why NYCC were not prepared to admit the press into the meeting as it was constructive and cordial.\n\n“We discussed a number of roads which are of concern to local residents and have made some limited progress.\n\n“The situation has not been helped by a central government which claims to have a levelling up agenda for the north but has reduced this year the highway maintenance grant by £4m, not levelling up at all in reality.”",

We made the sad decision to shut our doors on Church Street on August 19, 2021.\n\n“We would like to thank all our loyal customers who have supported us over the last 29 years at Lawrence Direct, some becoming true friends, a lot saying we are a true unique service which is going to be missed greatly.\n\n“New challenges and changes ahead for all of us.”\n\nThe Lawrence family has long been a familiar name in the retail sector in Oswestry.\n\nS Lawrence & Son Ltd began in 65 Church Street in 1954 Sam Lawrence, who was soon joined by John Lawrence.\n\nSally and Emma started Lawrence Direct in September 1992 at 55 Church Street, before moving to 24 Church Street.\n\nThe shop then moved two doors away to 20 Church Street, and later to 24 Church Street again.\n\nStaff members Jean Lawrence, Clare Morgan, Emma and Sally thanked customers for their support over the past 29 years.\n\nAlthough the business is leaving Church Street in a retail capacity, Lawrence’s will be carrying on with its printing services, larger copy jobs and bringing vinyl painting as a new service.\n\nIt will not be a walk-in service, but Lawrence’s can be contacted via email at lawrencedirect20@gmail.com or by contacting Sally on 07890713334 or Clare on 07932 277780.\n\nThey will also be contactable through Facebook and Instagram.",

    "doc": "Merchiston Surgery put out an open letter to patients after a rise in the number of threats and abuse faced by its health workers.\n\nGP practices in the region have seen a spike in activity in the space of 12 months, with 388,391 primary care appointments being carried out last month in Swindon, Wiltshire, Bath and North East Somerset, an increase of 73 per cent compared to the previous year.\n\nA spokesperson for the surgery on Highworth Road, Stratton St Margaret told the Adver: “This is unacceptable, we have always had a zero-tolerance policy towards abuse of all kinds and pre-Covid had cause to give written warnings to some patients.\n\n“However, there has been a significant increase in the verbal abuse that our staff are experiencing from some patients since the beginning of lockdown easing. There have also been recent instances when patients have caused physical damage to our property.”\n\n“Receptionists are regularly being threatened verbally by patients, which is distressing for all staff working at Merchiston Surgery. This reflects what is happening in many areas of the country.”\n\nThose incidents have directly affected the workers’ mental health and resilience. The spokesperson said: “At a time when the NHS is experiencing unprecedented demand for appointments in primary care and our staff are delivering Covid vaccinations at Steam – often on their days off or after their usual shift – this added pressure is unfair to staff who have worked throughout the pandemic and do their absolute best every day to help patients.\n\n“Thank you for those patients who have sent us messages and letters of support – we appreciate them so much.”\n\nIn the letter sent to patients and published on its website, the surgery said in extreme circumstances patients abusing staff may be removed from its patient list.\n\nIt read: “You may be aware from press and social media reports that there is increased demand for appointments nationally and at Merchiston we are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of requests for GP and nursing appointments.\n\n“As we are still in the Covid pandemic, the NHS recommends that we triage or phone back every patient who wants advice from a nurse, doctor or other healthcare professional.”\n\nThe surgery cannot offer GP appointments to book in advance. “These appointments are for routine matters and acute problems and are bookable same day in the morning from 8am and in the afternoon from 12. Clinic days and times vary for individual GPs and may change from week to week.\n\n“We also have a daily triage GP available to deal with clinically urgent same day requests from patients. This GP decides what and when treatment is appropriate.”\n\nDr Andrew Girdher, clinical chair of Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Clinical Commissioning Group said: “It is very concerning to hear of this behaviour, especially given that practice staff have played such a vital role in ensuring everyday health and care was able to continue in a Covid-safe way throughout the pandemic, while at the same time being the absolute driving force behind the extensive rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n“My colleagues, like others in the NHS, do all they can to provide high quality care on a daily basis and, while we recognise the last year has been very difficult for everyone and that some may feel frustration at being asked to wait for an appointment as teams prioritise those most in need, threatening or abusive behaviour is never acceptable.”\n\n\n\n",

    "doc": "Nicola Milner, from Llysfaen, was awarded the “Worshipful Livery Company of Wales Literacy Award” for achieving the grades needed for university whilst battling with dyslexia.\n\nHer tutor, Holly, nominated her for the award.\n\nShe originally studied GCSEs in Maths and English - at the college’s Rhos-on-Sea and Abergele campuses respectively - before gaining a place on the Access to Higher Education (HE) - Health course at Rhos.\n\nShe is now studying adult nursing at Bangor University, which she started last September.\n\nBefore her college studies, Nicola previously worked as a carer in the community for several years.\n\nBut she had always wanted to go into the adult nursing field, so sat the required GCSEs before enrolling on the Access to HE course.\n\nNicola has dyslexia, which made the literacy side of the course very difficult, so she had to work twice as hard.\n\nNot happy with just passing her units, she got distinctions across the board.\n\nNicola said: “I couldn’t believe it when I was told that I had won the award; I didn’t even know that Holly had entered me!\n\n“I will use the money to buy a much-needed printer to help with my university course.\n\n“There are so many apps now to aid dyslexics, and the university has been brilliant, even supplying me with a Dictaphone.\n\n“I had an amazing time at college. Both my tutors and my classmates were so supportive. I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support.”\n\nNicola would eventually like a career as a practitioner/prescriber.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCollege students can now have free sustainable period products delivered directly\n\nNorth Wales college group rolls out pods for 'quiet spaces'\n\nCollege's student union named best in Wales for fourth consecutive time\n\nTutor Holly Maxwell said: “We are really proud of Nicola’s achievements. She got the grades she deserved whilst at college. Considering the circumstances, this is an extremely impressive feat.”\n\nFounded in 1993, the Worshipful Livery Company of Wales (WLCOW) promotes education, the arts, science and technology in Wales.\n\nIt is dedicated to helping young people to develop their talents and skills by means of an annual awards programme of scholarships and bursaries to students in schools, universities and technical colleges across Wales, as well as to apprentices and young people in the armed forces.\n\nThe Access to Higher Education programme is a passport to university-level study and has been provided by Coleg Llandrillo for nearly 30 years.\n\nIt is a flexible programme which is designed for adults who have few, if any, school qualifications, but who wish to prepare for university-level study.\n\nFor more information about Access to Higher Education programmes at Coleg Llandrillo, go to www.gllm.ac.uk or email enquiries.llandrillo@gllm.ac.uk.",

We know this will be a painful and difficult time for them, hearing details once more of what happened to their loved ones.”\n\nHe said the Met was offering “every assistance” to the coroner and welcomed a “full examination of all the facts surrounding the tragic deaths”.\n\nHe said: “At the time of Port’s conviction, we apologised to the victims’ families and Daniel Whitworth’s partner for how we initially responded to the deaths, and I would like to apologise again.\n\n“Since Port’s offences came to light we have worked hard within the Met to improve both our processes and our wider knowledge across the organisation of a range of issues associated with the murders.\n\n“We will not prejudge the findings of the inquests but we will review any more improvements the jury and coroner identify that we need to make.\n\n“It is extremely important to us that members of the LGBT+ communities trust the police and feel confident they are being provided with the best possible service.”\n\nOn Friday, Sarah Munro, assistant coroner for the East London area, told jurors to focus on the evidence in court as they were sworn in to hear the inquests.\n\nShe told them: “On Tuesday… we will commence hearing inquests into the deaths of four young men who were murdered by a man called Stephen Port in 2014 and 2015.\n\n“They were killed by him with overdoses of a date rape drug called GHB and their bodies were discarded by him yards from where we are sitting now.”\n\nThe families of the victims, who are represented in court, are expected to attend the inquests.\n\nHave you got a story for us?

There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nCouncillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.\n\n“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.\n\n“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.\n\n“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nBut, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.\n\nThat decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.\n\nThe news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.\n\nYvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.\n\n\"I objected to this application on the grounds of its encroachment on the greenbelt, traffic congestion and air quality. It was a development too far and I am pleased that the Planning Inspector dismissed the appeal by Peel Investments.”",

City firms, cultural institutions and political bodies across the capital and nationally are also being asked for their views.\n\nAll submissions received will be considered before a recommendation is made by the Taskforce to the City Corporation’s Policy and Resources Committee for a final decision.\n\nPeople can take part in the consultative exercise online by the deadline of 24 November at cityoflondon.gov.uk/ historiclandmarksconsultation or by writing to:\n\nTackling Racism Taskforce\n\nCity of London Corporation\n\nGuildhall, PO Box 270\n\nLondon\n\nEC2P 2EJ\n\nFor the latest headlines from the City of London and beyond, follow City Matters on Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn.",

    "doc": "People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire\n\nPeople in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire\n\nFive people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe event, which was described as a \"socially distanced stand-out\", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.\n\nThe event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.\n\nThe event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3\n\nHer remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.\n\nA member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.\n\nOne speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: \"We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.\"\n\nPeople in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire\n\nOn a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.\n\n\"We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,\" they said.\n\n\"It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.\n\n\"Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.\n\n\"The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.\"\n\nThe event in Belfast follows other similar \"reclaim the streets\" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.\n\nIn a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: \"Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening\n\n“Shortly before 6pm, approximately around 20 people had gathered at the event which was peaceful. This number quickly grew to approximately 100.\n\n\"As a result, officers engaged with the event organisers and explained and encouraged people to comply with the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020. Subsequently, five people were issued with Fixed Penalty Notices under the Health Protection Regulations.\n\n“We would appeal to everyone to adhere to the current Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations to play their part in slowing the spread of this virus and helping everyone stay safe and save lives.”",

The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.\n\nHuish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.\n\nUnfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.\n\nPetroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.\n\nAfter an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.\n\nThe second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.\n\nHuish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.\n\nNot the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.\n\nPetroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!\n\nThere are open evenings on November 1 & 2 at the main Barnstaple campus and the team would love to chat about sport with anyone considering a course at Petroc.",

    "doc": "Police love acronyms.\nThey learn them by heart, pick them up from older coppers, accept them from senior officers and if you ever listened to a police radio when you could still pick it up on your transistor you may have even heard a few.\nOf course, we can’t listen to police radios anymore because the Airwave system is uncrackable. But the acronyms remain and we sometimes hear them used on TV cop shows which try to be authentic-sounding.\nRead more: Walking through Plymouth's red light district where sex workers have all but vanished\nThe vast majority of them are merely a shorthand way of explaining important information, roles, incidents or titles.\nBut occasionally, like a lot of organisations who deal with the public, they create special codewords which are, shall we say, less PC than a PC…\nHere's our guide to police slang. You'll find the official terms at the top - and a few unofficial phrases at the end of the article.\nThe official terms\nLOS – Lost or Stolen (“The car’s LOS, Sarge…”)\nCRO – Criminal Records Office or Criminal Record (“Sarge, he’s got a CRO)\nPNC – Police National Computer\nRTC – Road Traffic Collision, which used to be RTA (Road Traffic Accident) until, as any Hot Fuzz film fan knows, vocab guidelines state police no longer refer to such incidents as ‘accidents’, they’re now collisions. Because ‘accident’ implies there's nobody to blame.\nMisper – a Missing Person (“Sarge, is Lord Lucan still a misper?”)\nTWOC – Taking Without Owner's Consent (“Ere, bey, have you been done for twokking cars again?”)\nPSU - Police Support Unit is a team of officers trained in public order and are used in major incidents, support other officers and bashing in doors with the Big Red Key (see later). In Devon and Cornwall they are now called the FSG – Force Support Group. The Metropolitan Police had a similar team called the SPG – Special Patrol Group. They were heavily criticised following their policing of an Anti-Nazi League demonstration where a demonstrator was struck with a baton and died. They were then renamed the TSG – Territorial Support Group. Just like how Windscale was renamed Sellafield after the nuclear power plant had a rather unfortunate fire.\nFLO – Family Liaison Officer. These are officers who work closely with victims of serious crimes, such as the family of murder victims, or tragic deaths such as fatal road collisions.\nTK – Telephone Kiosk. One officer admitted that in their early days on the job they were told to attend an incident at a “TK at Royal Parade”. They spent several minutes interviewing staff at TK Maxx before being told over the radio they were in the wrong place.\nCHIS – Covert Human Intelligence Source. Alternatively known in court as “an informant”. Known in common parlance as a “grass” or “snitch” who may eventually come to a violent end. Hence the phrase “snitches get stitches”.\nPOLAC – Police Accident. Usually a road accident involving a police vehicle. This will inevitably lead to the aforementioned driver having to purchase a large quantity of cakes for his laughing colleagues back at the station. (“Sorry Sarge, I think I may have reversed the riot van into your new Audi”)\nOIC – Officer In Case (“Right, Constable Crap-driver, you’re now the OIC on this abducted-by-alien complaint”)\nSIO – Senior Investigating Officer\nPOLSA – Police Search Advisor – a specially-trained officer who advises on the best approach to carry out searches in Misper cases or suspected murders where bodies are yet to be found.\nCode 11 – Off duty (“Sorry Sarge, I can’t attend that alien abduction, I’m Code 11 as of 10 minutes ago”)\nASNT – Area Search No Trace. When police have searched area for a suspect but there’s no trace of them.\nDL – Driving Licence (“Sarge, got a little green man here with what looks like a dodgy DL”)\nCode 4 – a meal break. (“Can someone else go to that Sarge, I’m Code 4?”)\nRJ - Restorative Justice. (“Well Sarge, could he at least repaint the fence he’s drawn a k**b on? The victim is okay with some RJ”)\nCIM - Critical Incident Manager. Invariably an Inspector rank officer who oversees all the live “critical” incidents going on in the area and makes the decisions which ensure these situations don’t get any worse.\nNFP – Normal For Plymouth (“Sarge, we found the naked bloke wearing a tutu, off his head on mushrooms and mumbling something about ‘Green Army’.” “Yes lad, that’s NFP”.)\n(Image: Carl Eve)\nNFA – No Further Action. When police either cannot get the evidence to convince the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) to go for a charge, the case is dropped and the person is told there will be NFA\nRUI – Released Under Investigation. Since bail has been hurled out the door by the Government, people are told they are not on bail, but they are RUI and can be arrested at any moment as inquiries continue. This has been sold to the public by the Government as a good thing. No-one in the police thinks it is a good thing.\nNPAS – National Police Air Service. As part of a cost-cutting exercise police helicopters were taken out of police force’s control and a single body was created to cover the country.\nFPN – Fixed Penalty Notice. Effectively a fine handed to you by police\nAIO – All In Order (“Sarge, I’ve check the house where the Demis Roussos was being played louder than a jet engine. It’s AIO”)\nWOA – Words Of Advice (“Sarge, we pulled the driver over who had a cow in the back seat of his Land Rover and, as it’s NFP we’ve given him WOA”)\n(Image: Jon Bishop)\nUNIFI – Unified Police Intelligence. The police’s crime, intelligence and custody computer database. It sends officers mad trying to get it to work. Imagine Windows 89 but on its last legs.\nNOIP – Notice of Intended Prosecution. Effectively a note which tells you your future may well involve a court visit.\nSOCA – Serious and Organised Crime. As opposed to Jocular and Erratic Crime. This is the environment where you encounter men called Dave with broken noses and leather jackets who keep money in large rolls, run a scrap metal merchants and can get you a shooter to go with a kilo of coke.\nSOCIT – Serious and Organised Crime Investigation Team. Where Detectives go when they want to be their childhood heroes, Bodie and Doyle.\nSOCO – Scene of Crime Officer (“Sarge, can you get CIS down here for forensics?” “No Constable Savage, this isn’t CSI Miami - in Plymouth we call them SOCOs”)\nSODAIT – Sexual Offences and Domestic Abuse Investigation Team.\nWhere to get support for mental health There are dozens of places to get online help, including web-chats, text help, phone-calls and even apps with games to help you manage your feelings.

Mental health charity Mind: If you need non-urgent information about mental health support and services that may be available to you please call the Mind Infoline on 0300 123 3393 or email info@mind.org.uk\nSOPO – Sex Offenders Prevention Order. An order by the court which attempts to keep sex offenders from committing sex offences. Considered by many Plymouth people to be less effective than a cigar cutter.\nSOR – Sex Offenders Register. You can end up on this list from doing everything from patting a person of the opposite sex on the bottom against their wishes to the serial rape of children.\nASBO – Antisocial Behaviour Order. Considered by some to be a badge of honour, although not an ideal addition to your CV.\n(Image: Carl Eve)\nABE – Achieving Best Evidence. Where victims of serious sexual assaults are video interviewed for their very first statement, which can then be used in court.\nBCU – Basic Command Unit is the largest unit into which territorial British Police forces are divided. Plymouth is populated enough to be an entire BCU. Remarkably, the entire county of Cornwall is just one BCU. In the same way that it’s one sandwich short of a picnic.\nD & D – Drunk and Disorderly, not Dungeons and Dragons.\nSection 165 – No insurance seizure. Where a vehicle is seized by police and may well be crushed because the driver had not insurance.\nSection 59 – Antisocial behaviour order vehicle seizure. Where the owner has previously been formerly warned for their antisocial driving and yet has continued to drive like a prat, and thus lose their vehicle.\nPSU – Public order Support Unit. Usually a police van/people carrier which everyone outside of the police force call a “riot van”. Usually has a pack of Haribo in between the two front seats.\nMOE – Method of Entry. (“Sarge, we’re going to use the chainsaw through the front door as our MOE”.)\nAP – Aggrieved Person. The injured party. The victim.\nARV – Armed Response Vehicle. A vehicle with armed response officers (and their guns). Often heavily ladened with “Gucci gear” (police-style equipment which is not standard issue gear and is instead purchased by ARV officers from numerous US-type websites because it looks cool/imposing/flash/intimidating)\nBig Red Key – battering ram for smashing down doors. It’s big. It’s red. It opens doors.\n(Image: Carl Eve)\nOT – Overtime (“Sarge, will I be getting any OT for this?”)\nHooly Bar – a large iron bar with a large spike at the end. Used for smashing in windows and distracting occupants while another officer uses the Big Red Key to gain entry. Usually at properties where illegal recreational pharmaceuticals are being kept, grown, created, smoked, ingested, injected.\nRefs – Food. (“Sarge, I’ve been on scene guard for six hours. Any chance of some Refs”)\nSpray – Captor canister incapacitant. AKA pepper spray.\nStabby – A protective vest worn by officers in the hope it will minimise the risk of being stabbed.\nLid – A Police hat.

That became the Local Investigation Team - a LIT.

    "doc": "Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter\n\nHertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space\n\nA farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.\n\nOfficers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.\n\nCabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.\n\nFollowing a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.\n\nConservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.\n\nShe pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.\n\nThe Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.\n\nResponding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.\n\nShe accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.\n\nCllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.\n\nThe council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.\n\nBut Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.\n\nCllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.\n\nLabour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”\n\nIn response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.\n\nAfter the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration. The remaining four Labour and Community First committee members voted to confirm the original cabinet decision.",

    "doc": "SICKNESS rates among NHS staff have almost doubled in a year - amid talk of ‘burnout’ forcing retirement due to the pandemic - according to concerning new figures.\n\nThe report from NHS Digital reveals that in December, the sickness absence rate among staff working across Barnsley’s Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) - which plans and monitors frontline healthcare services in the borough - was 2.85 per cent of the 144 staff employed.\n\nThose roles include professionally qualified clinical staff, hospital and community health service doctors, nurses, therapeutic staff, infrastructure and management.\n\nA year prior, in December 2020, the absence rate was 1.57 per cent, and the latest figure is the highest in two years since December 2019’s 2.91 per cent.\n\nStaffing levels at Barnsley CCG have fallen through the last year, from 154 in March, but have otherwise been on an upward trend since 2013.\n\nThe figures show Barnsley Hospital’s rate is also the highest in almost a year, at 6.28 per cent of 4,066 staff.\n\nSenior councillors on Barnsley Council’s overview and scrutiny committee discussed a wide-ranging report on a recently-established ‘place-based partnership’ last week which sets out the scale of issues facing services in the borough.\n\nOne of the most discussed issues affecting the care sector has been staffing - both retention and recruitment - which has caused knock-on effects, particularly to local mental health services.\n\nThe report said ‘close monitoring’ of staff was ongoing to understand their health and wellbeing needs, but that it was ‘important’ to continue paying attention to these amid the move to the new model.\n\n“There are high levels of staff absence due to Covid and infection prevention and control measures continue to put additional strain on the workforce and estate,” it said.\n\n“Employers across our health and care system are seeing higher levels of burnout and more colleagues accessing support services but more still who would benefit.\n\n“Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and South West Yorkshire Partnership Foundation Trust (SWYPFT) have reported higher numbers of staff retiring in the latter part of 2021/22.\n\n“In some cases, these are colleagues who have delayed retirement to support the pandemic response, but some retirements are reportedly because of burnout.\n\n“Through the next stage it is important that organisations pay attention to how people are feeling, recovering, and responding to the next set of challenges.\n\n“Close monitoring of staff turnover is taking place to develop appropriate plans to support retention and recruitment of staff and already positive work has taken place to support staff’s health and wellbeing including better access to support including counsellors.”\n\nThe CCG is set to be ‘abolished’ under ambitious new plans to create integrated health and social care in Barnsley.\n\nThe new partnership - between Barnsley CCG, the council, NHS trusts, and voluntary services including Barnsley Hospice - will usher in a new statutory Integrated Care Board (ICB) in July and then a further Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) aimed at addressing ‘wider health, public health, and social care needs’ in September.",

Closing early for Christmas or extending the holidays is not the answer.\nWhat do you think about the schools closing a week earlier than planned for Christmas? Do you think others should follow suit? Would it leave you struggling for childcare? Let us know in the comments here or on our Manchester Family Facebook page.\n“The Chief Medical Officer has been clear that schools should remain open and has highlighted the damage caused by not being in education to children’s education, development and mental health, which greatly outweighs any other risks. Children are at very low risk from the virus, and staff are not at higher risk than those working in other sectors.”\nThe schools closing a week early include:\nManor Green Primary Academy, Denton, Tameside\nOld Trafford Community Academy, Trafford\nFreehold Community Primary, Oldham\nLyndhurst Primary, Oldham\nCoppice Primary Academy, Oldham\nRoundthorn Primary Academy, Oldham\nDeeplish Primary Academy, Rochdale\n(Image: Deeplish Primary Academy)\nCheryl, who works as an A&E nurse, is hoping the Trust responds to the government and reverts back to the original closure date.\nShe said: \"We had a letter stating the extra week is now a holiday and the children will not be expected to do any work, which is better, but it still doesn’t help with the last minute childcare issues a lot of us working parents will have.\n\"I understand why they are doing it but I think it’s unnecessary. The original finish date would be better for everyone because it is just so last minute. As it stands I might have to have last minute emergency time off work and as a nurse this is not professional or helpful at this current time.\"\nFocus Trust’s chief executive Helen Rowland said last week that they 'recognise the short notice may be an issue for some families' but want to 'ensure that no one is forced to self-isolate over the holiday because of someone they have come into contact with at school'.\nThe Manchester Evening News has approached Focus Trust for a further comment about the talks with government.\nHas your school had to send children home to self-isolate?

I didn’t think we would get this many calls.\n\n“As much as we can, we will help. I can’t imagine what I would do in that situation.\n\n“It’s not our war but you still have to help.\n\n“We are collecting until Thursday and I know it's short notice but if we need more items and it goes on for longer, we can expand that.”\n\nSebastian said he will help as much as he can\n\nThey will not be collecting more clothes and instead ask for the likes of toiletries, blankets, toys and everyday essentials.\n\nSebastian is collecting from his other work and his partner is collecting from her work to add to the effort.\n\nHis friend, Jeff Leake from Arnway Limited at the industrial centre saw Sebastian’s post and he has the vehicles to move items.\n\nREAD MORE > Where in Warrington you can donate to Ukraine\n\nJeff, of Holmes Chapel, said: “We all clumped together and it started off being a collection point to now we might be looking at helping more by taking stuff and collecting around Warrington.\n\n“Whatever you think you’d need for a week or two away and the things that you would grab on your way out of the house.\n\n“As good as these major charities are and as big as they are, it can be quite hard for them to switch direction and divert from one disaster to another.\n\n“We just want to be a part of something that is fast, reactive and gets stuff going.”\n\nThe 29-year-old continued: “People from all walks of life are helping from CEOs to people that don’t earn a lot of money – people are doing what they can to help.\n\n“A little bit or a lot, people are doing what they can. Anything is better than sitting back and watching it happen.\n\n“Around 95 per cent of this effort has come from the Polish community in Warrington and they know what life is like in that area.\n\n“We’re not calling ourselves saviours but we have the space and the gear to move it around, it all amounts up.\n\n“We have a busy couple of days planned.”\n\nOther collection points for donations across Warrington include Wisla Mini Markets, TK Maxx, The Feathers and The Cat and Lion.",

This could include establishing wild habitats and green corridors in areas of economic and nature deprivation or naturalising school grounds or unused areas. The pandemic has demonstrated just how important access to a well-cared for natural environment is to communities across the UK.Kirsty Martuccio, Team Wilder Officer at Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said: “This is a really exciting and valuable project, enabling communities suffering with rural deprivation and social isolation to take action to improve natural spaces on their doorstep.\"We will inspire and up-skill individuals, and support community projects, to bring back nature and make a tangible change. Communities will be empowered to continue the work within their own groups and organisations, leaving a legacy that lasts long beyond the programme.”Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust will support various new groups over the next two years, working with communities who need help identifying and developing their local green spaces, to benefit individuals and groups within their community.Evidence shows that people are increasingly disconnected from nature, with profound consequences for health and it also means they are less likely to protect their natural heritage.",

It was unveiled on September 13, 1919, by Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Hope.\n\nMore than 100 former pupils had answered the call of duty and the names of 20 of them appeared on the memorial.\n\nWhen Crookston School closed in about 1958, the memorial was taken to Inveresk Cemetery.\n\nIn 2014, Wallyford Community Council secured funding from the Centenary Memorials Restoration Fund, administered by the War Memorials Trust, along with funding from East Lothian Council’s Civic Pride Fund, to have restoration work carried out on the memorial stone.",

    "doc": "The council has put in almost £500,000 into this security system which was an important factor in catching the killers of Scott Anderton last year.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, the 33-year-old was lured to the canalside in Leigh by three callous teenagers who would go on to stab him 35 times before chucking him into the water to die. Video footage, which formed part of Greater Manchester Police’s investigation, showed Liam Bailey, 19, Harry Maher, 16, and Liam O’Brien, 17, leading Mr Anderton to a secluded stretch of the canal, off King Street.\n\nThe trio were all jailed for their roles in the brutal killing after a five week trial at Manchester Crown Court in November 2021.\n\nScott Anderton\n\nBailey, of Diamond Street, Leigh, was sentenced to life in custody with a minimum term of 23 years and four months. Maher, of Green Lane, Standish, was also jailed for life and must serve at least 16 years before he is eligible for parole.\n\nO’Brien, of Schofield Street, Leigh, was ordered to serve 10 years in prison.\n\nFor Cllr Kevin Anderson, portfolio holder for Police, Crime and Civil Contingencies, this CCTV funding commitment is a ‘personal victory’. The funding will go towards increasing the number of cameras and improving the imagery.\n\n“We hope with the investment it makes people feel safer,” Coun Anderson said. “For me the murder stuck in my mind to show the importance of good CCTV and how it can help – and we got the convictions at Manchester Crown Court as a result.\n\n“CCTV acts as more of a deterrent and a warning for those doing things against the law – we’ve had a difficult period of time with the pandemic. There seems to have been a rise in terms of aggressive behaviour and letting off steam and that can boil over to something worse.”\n\nSince 2019, there have been 118 extra CCTV cameras installed across the borough, with 52 of those coming to Leigh. A further 25 were installed in Platt Bridge, five at Chapel Lane Car Park, 30 on Standishgate in the town centre and six at Haigh Hall.\n\nThe council also issued 31 Rapid Deployment Cameras in this time. This was to support teams fighting antisocial behaviour and fly tipping.\n\n“Our CCTV network has undergone a major expansion as part of our multi-agency approach to preventing crime and anti-social behaviour across Wigan Borough,” Coun Anderson continued. “Most recently the council invested almost £500,000 into our CCTV network, with £56,000 going on improving the network in Platt Bridge and a further £420,000 earmarked for new and upgraded cameras in Wigan, Leigh, Ashton and Pemberton.\n\n“State-of-the-art CCTV cameras have also been placed at well-known fly tip hotspots, including in Ince, Platt Bridge, Hindley. Last year Leigh West was also awarded a share of the Safer Streets Fund and additional CCTV cameras were a key part of this £500,000 scheme.\n\n“The expansion of our CCTV network will continue following our latest successful bid to the Safer Streets Fund which awarded the council with almost £750,000 to improve safety and deter anti-social behaviour in Platt Bridge and Scholes. This investment is in addition to many great initiatives being overseen by the Place and Community Safety Partnership, which aims to ensure Wigan Borough is a safe place to live and work for us all.”\n\nThis commitment to night time safety was something that helped get Wigan town centre Purple Flag Status. This is the recognition of excellence in the evening and night-time economy – a place that is diverse, vibrant, safe, attractive and welcoming.\n\nIn addition to this commitment, Coun Anderson is excited about the relaunch of the neighbourhood watch initiative across the borough in order to increase public involvement in preventing crime. It is hoped this will improve public engagement with police and appeals to help solve crimes.",

It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.\n\nIan Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).\n\nHe said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.\n\n“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”\n\nThe 2,600 housing site highlighted in red (Image: RBWM)\n\nWithin the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.\n\nMr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.\n\nA new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.\n\nIn addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.\n\nREAD MORE: Maidenhead could see new tapas bar move in\n\nExisting bus routes could be reconfigured to be diverted to the proposed site. New bus stops could be added to the site.\n\nThis critical infrastructure will be funded by a community infrastructure levy – which is a tariff on housing development – funds from the developer via section 106 agreement, grants, and investments.\n\nElsewhere in the meeting, residents were told the 2,600 homes site will be split equally between houses and flats.\n\nEach area within the site will have different character areas. For example, the northern part of the golf course site ‘is likely to be’ predominantly apartments, which could be between four to six-storeys in height.",

    "doc": "There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.\n\nMany of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.\n\nWhether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?\n\nREAD MORE: Good pub guide 2022: Hertfordshire's seven best pubs according to expert reviews\n\nHertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.\n\nThe Golden Lion, Hoddesdon\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\nSituated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.\n\nThe staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.\n\nAlford Arms, Frithsden\n\n(Image: The Alford Arms)\n\nInside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a \"pubby gem\" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.\n\nThe great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.\n\nThere are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.\n\nBricklayers Arms, Flaunden\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\nTucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.\n\nIt has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.\n\nCollege Arms, Hertford Heath\n\n(Image: Trip Advisor)\n\nAccording to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has \"hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year\". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.\n\nTheir menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.\n\nThe Cricketers, Sarratt\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\nIn the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.\n\nIt offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.\n\nThe Duke of York, Barnet\n\n(Image: The Duke of York)\n\nJust on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.\n\nThe Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.\n\nHolly Bush, Potters Crouch\n\n(Image: The Holly Bush)\n\nThis is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.\n\nThere are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.\n\nThe food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.\n\nPrae Wood Arms, St Albans\n\n(Image: Prae Wood Arms)\n\nThe Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.\n\nThere’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.\n\nFood includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.\n\nRed Lion, Preston\n\n(Image: The Red Lion)\n\nThe Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.\n\nIt's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.\n\nFurry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.\n\nThe Waterside, Rickmansworth\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\nSituated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.\n\nSign up for our newsletters.\n\nContact us with your stories.",

I have contacted the Tory party, Labour and the Lib Dems. None of them have bothered to respond,\" she claimed.\n\nDeborah has contacted parish councils and they too have not helped. A couple have replied saying they \"could not justify the expense\", she said.\n\nDeborah Lewis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Since when has anyone needed to 'justify' supporting the bereaved? Many of us have so far have never been permitted a wake or memorial and an opportunity to unite in our grief.\"\n\nDeborah added: \"Many of these officials will stand before the public on May 6 'claiming 'to care for their constituents'. This simply does not seem to be true...Ironically, these will be the very same people who will be expected to receive an invite to this event and claim they have the bereaved in their thought and hearts.\n\nShe said the Parks Trust has been helpful and she has obtained all the necessary licences and permission to hold the memorial event. Milton Keynes Community Foundation has also agreed £3,000 of funding.\n\nDeborah's mum and dad passed away just six months apart, though her mum died of cancer. The memorial event is to remember all lives lost during the pandemic, whether or not Covid was the cause of death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeborah founded a support group called Covid19 Families because she was horrified at the lack of support she received when her father died. During lockdown, shut away from sympathetic relatives, colleagues and friends, and unable to even organise a proper funeral, she felt very alone, she said.\n\n\"The one group who are actually receiving very, very little support are the Covid bereaved... It's hard enough to lose someone at anytime but losing someone during the lockdown was and still is horrendous, and the long term mental health effects of grieving during lockdown are yet to manifest themselves.\"\n\nCovid19 Families group soon spread all over the UK. There are now 37 regional groups, supporting more than 3,500 bereaved people, said Deborah.\n\nShe believes the MK memorial event would attract national media and TV coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It will allow the many who have been denied a moment to reflect and unite in grief that final act of closure. Not just the families, but friends, neighbours, work colleagues, and associates,\" she said.\n\n\"For over a year now, those experiencing grief have been denied the right to remember and mark the passing of their loved ones due to pandemic restrictions, and for many, myself including this is an important part of the grieving process - closure.\n\n\"This event now has the dubious honour of becoming the very first public attendance memorial event to take place anywhere in the UK and will quite literally shine a light on Milton Keynes and show just how a memorial event can go ahead in a safe and socially distanced manner leading the way for the rest of the country.\"\n\nBut, without more cash, the event could be in jeopardy.",

The case officer has come to a firm view that there is a proven need (for housing in the area).\"\n\nDevelopment management boss Alastair Hamilton defended the report and its recommendations, adding: “There is a shortfall and a policy which makes provision to consider and approve housing sites for affordable housing outwith settlement boundaries.\"\n\nFive councillors voted in favour of a motion tabled by Cllr Tim Brett (Lib Dem, Tay Bridgehead) and seconded by Cllr Miklinski to refuse the plans.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nHowever, nine voted in favour of Cllr Jonny Tepp's (Lib Dem, Tay Bridgehead) amendment, seconded by Cllr Karen Marjoram (SNP, Cupar) to approve the plans in line with the report.\n\nThe homes will be built to the Passivhaus standard that are highly energy efficient.

We’ve had restrictions, furlough, grants - all these things thrown at businesses, but they have been able to cope with what has been a very challenging landscape.\n\nLeeds is “on the front foot”, Mr Cooper said, with lockdown providing opportunities for growth and change\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n“I’ve seen incredible resilience and collaboration, people working together in ways that I’ve not seen before. Competitors sharing their practices and signage and working together.\n\n“As a city, we need to work together. That was the case last year and it’s great to see that carrying on as we come out of the restrictions.”\n\nNon-essential retailers have now been closed for more than three months. The hospitality sector has sat empty since November.\n\nAs some businesses prepare to welcome back customers from April 12, Mr Cooper said he has noticed a buzz about the city centre again.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nLeedsBID, a not-for-profit organisation, has helped to shape Leeds City Council’s reopening plans and coordinate distribution of the Government’s Welcome Back Fund, designed to get business back on their feet.\n\n“It felt like a town closed down for winter in the city centre,” Mr Cooper added.\n\n“But there’s lots of activity going on again, owners getting back into their shops and starting to prepare.\n\n“They’re chomping at the bit to open. But there is some apprehension as you can’t always just turn on a tap. You need a bit of preparation, particularly in the hospitality sector.”\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nMr Cooper said he was encouraged by the investment put into the city centre during lockdown, with big refurbishment projects such as at the Queens Hotel and retailers like Decathlon choosing to open new sites in Leeds.\n\nHe added: “Leeds is very much on the front foot, it’s been proactive in thinking longer-term and investors are thinking about Leeds’ long term game too.”\n\nDespite his optimism, Mr Cooper does not underestimate the challenges the pandemic has presented to businesses.\n\nLeedsBID is preparing a catalogue of events over the summer to generate footfall and drive customers back to the city centre.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIt has lobbied on behalf of businesses to create new outdoor spaces and provides support through Engine Room - a hub offering free resources and training programmes including how to adapt to restrictions.\n\nMr Cooper said he hopes the new ways of working created by the pandemic may provide opportunities for positive change.\n\n“Short-term opportunities because of Covid might turn into long-term changes in the city centre for good”, he added.\n\n“If we want to encourage more of a cafe culture of people sitting outside, that provides opportunities to change the look and feel of the city centre.”\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nPeople’s spending habits will also have changed, Mr Cooper added, and building confidence in visiting the city centre will be the key to drive back customers.\n\nMr Cooper said: “Historically, Leeds has been a very traditional 9-5 city. We now have different working patterns and we’re not all coming into the city at the same time, certainly as restrictions are first lifted.\n\n“It’s a very different city centre. Behaviours will change, people will be a bit nervous at first - it’s a bit like riding a bike again.\n\n“We need to build confidence and reassure people that when you go into shop staff have been trained to make people safe.”\n\nWhat are Mr Cooper’s hopes for the summer ahead?\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n“We want to see a very busy, vibrant, safe and happy city centre,” he said.\n\n“The events we’re planning are centred around families and people of all ages, encouraging people to come back to enjoy the city centre they love and the haunts they have missed.\n\n“We’re looking to create a happy and welcoming city. One where people are generous, kind and understanding towards each other.\n\n“I think people’s behaviours have changed as a result of the pandemic and we want to embody that.”\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nMr Cooper believes collaboration and a community spirit are what's needed to help the city centre bounce back as restrictions are eased.\n\nHe added: “If there is anything the pandemic has taught us, it’s that we can’t rest on our laurels.\n\n“We need to continue that good collaboration and working together. I think the city will be stronger for it.”",

    "doc": "What is your connection to East Anglia?\n\nAmelia: I am pretty much East Anglian born and bred. We moved to Fressingfield on the Norfolk/Suffolk border when I was one. My parents still live in the same house in the village.\n\nDavid: I was born in Rochford in Essex and have always lived and worked in the East Anglian region. First at Essex FM radio in Southend from 1995, then at the BBC in Chelmsford, before moving to Norwich in 2001 to work at BBC East. I joined ITV News Anglia in the summer of 2021.\n\nWhat’s your East Anglian heaven?\n\nAmelia: I love the big skies and the beaches and the feeling of home.\n\nDavid: Well it has to be the beaches for me. Having grown up by the sea in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, I gravitate towards the water. I took up surfing in 2004, so the beaches of Norfolk and Suffolk are my happy places.\n\nWhat’s your East Anglian hell?\n\nAmelia: It’s a bit of a hassle getting anywhere else quickly either by road or train.\n\nDavid: I agree with Amelia. Getting to and from anywhere can take its time, but that adds to the charm, right?\n\nYour favourite local restaurants?\n\nAmelia: I love getting fish and chips from the ‘black hut’ in the car park at Dunwich and eating them on the beach. I used to do that as a child and now enjoy doing it with our girls\n\nDavid: For a special occasion I love the Wildebeest in Stoke Holy Cross, but also love grabbing a coffee and a bite from North Sea Coffee on the prom in Cromer.\n\nDo you have a favourite East Anglian landmark?\n\nAmelia: The war memorial on the A11 at Elveden. If we’ve been away it means we’re nearly home.\n\nDavid: It has to be Cromer Pier for me. From my surfboard I've stared at it so many times. It's a wonderful structure.\n\nThe best thing that happens in East Anglia every year?\n\nAmelia: The seasons. They are beautiful and clearly defined here and I love that.\n\nDavid: I agree with Amelia on that one. Being surrounded by nature in this part of the world you certainly notice the changes far more.\n\nWhat is your specialist Mastermind subject?\n\nAmelia: I would be dreadful at that. I am a “know a little about lots of things” sort of girl!\n\nDavid: Probably Star Wars!\n\nWhat’s always in your fridge?\n\nSalad, cheese and a cold beer...or three.\n\nWhat’s your simple philosophy of life?\n\nAmelia: It’s short. Live it!\n\nDavid: Always be nice to people.\n\nDo you have a favourite film?\n\nAmelia: Love Actually\n\nDavid: Star Wars. But also Jaws and Ghostbusters.\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nAmelia: Weekend chambermaid at the Oaksmere Hotel near Eye in Suffolk (aged 15).\n\nDavid: Spud boy in a fish and chip shop in Essex, I worked at a boatyard too at 15 years old. I was paid £1.50 an hour.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nAmelia: My family.\n\nDavid: My family...and my surf board.\n\nWhat’s your worst character trait?\n\nAmelia: I have little patience\n\nDavid Me too. Hurry up!\n\nWhere is your favourite holiday destination?\n\nAmelia: I love the Greek islands and the north Norfolk coast.\n\nDavid: Obviously the north Norfolk coast...and Portugal, the surf there is amazing.\n\nBest day of your life?\n\nAmelia: Marrying David, becoming a mum and then a family of 4. I know that’s three days.\n\nDavid: Marrying Amelia, and becoming a dad.\n\nWhat’s your favourite breakfast?\n\nAmelia: Fruit, yoghurt, granola and honey. I could eat that for every meal.\n\nDavid: A full English.\n\nWhat’s your favourite tipple?\n\nAmelia: A glass of chilled white wine.\n\nDavid: Cold beer, always.\n\nWhat’s your hidden talent?\n\nAmelia: I play the piano and I am learning the saxophone.\n\nDavid: Not sure I have any.\n\nWhat’s your earliest memory?\n\nAmelia: On the beach at Waldringfield where my grandparents took a leading role with the sailing club.\n\nDavid: On the beach with my late parents. My love for the seaside started at a very young age, thanks to mum and dad.\n\nWhat would you like played at your funeral?\n\nAmelia: Whatever my family would like to listen to.\n\nDavid: Something relevant I guess. Our first dance at our wedding was to ‘Somewhere beyond the sea’ - that would be a good one.\n\nTell us something people don’t know about you?\n\nAmelia: I’m not sure there is anything. What you see is what you get\n\nDavid: Growing up I wanted to be an actor, both my parents were. But I'm very happy doing what I do.\n\nWhat’s the worst thing anyone has ever said to you?\n\nAmelia: “I’m sorry, it’s cancer.” I was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year and underwent a course of radio and chemotherapy. Thanks to the wonderful staff at the N&N my six months scans were clear and I am feeling great.\n\nDavid: Amelia telling me about her diagnosis.\n\nTell us why you live here and nowhere else?\n\nAmelia: It’s home. Simple as that\n\nDavid: We grew up here and it's everything to us.\n\nWhat do you want to tell our readers about most?\n\nAmelia: Watch BBC Look East, BBC 1 at 6.30pm every weekday.\n\nDavid: Watch ITV News, Anglia ITV at 6pm weekdays.\n\nIf you have a story, email gina@hallfarmfornham.com or follow Twitter: @geewizzgee1 Instagram: @ginalong_geewizz\n\n\n\n",

For petrol, its £2 per point.\nThese Clubcard points can be exchanged for Tesco Clubcard Vouchers - 150 points means £1.50 off in store.\nIf you want something different, these vouchers can be exchanged for other rewards such as days out or money off meals in top restaurants.\nDepending how you spend your voucher, the value can increase.\nPoints can currently be collected using either a physical Tesco Clubcard, a key fob or Tesco Clubcard App.\nSign up to the EssexLive newsletter If you're looking for a way to stay up-to-date with the latest breaking news from around Essex, the EssexLive newsletter is a good place to start.

Situated in @CovCityCentre, it will host the incredible @ChoirOfMan, @Circolombia and @DinoWorldLive from July. Book your tickets now at coventry2021.co.uk.\"\nInstagram users also shared their excitement ahead of the Garden's July opening. One user commented: \"This looks magical!.\"\nAnother added: \"Love the look of this.\"\nWhat can we expect to see?\nOrganisers say Assembly Festival Garden will be open from July 1 to mid-October.\nPerformances will take place in the Queen of Flanders, an iconic and beautiful 1,000-seater double-decker Spiegeltent; the Piccolo, a smaller 180-seat Spiegeltent; a treehouse that will look out over the site; and an outdoor venue in front of the Piccolo which can play to the entire audience in the Garden.\nThe site will also play host to a mouth-watering selection of local food makers.\nThere will be a series of productions spanning cabaret, circus, comedy and children’s shows that will call the Gardens home for the summer, as well as a selection of high-profile comedy and music gigs from well-known faces alongside rising stars.\nFor more information and tickets visit: https://assemblyfestivalgarden.com/\nKeep up with all of the latest local news with our daily newsletter",

I have been training on the sly for it!\n\n“I always have been doing 10Ks, but I would never have done a 5K. It would be out of my zone, in a sense, so it’s a challenge for me because it is a quicker run, but I can’t wait.\n\n“It should be good fun. I was always a runner since I was at school. I wouldn’t be a competitive runner that has competed a thousand times, but I am looking forward to this one, because it is a unique run.”\n\nBen and Murdocks were delighted to be able to provide sponsorship for an event that has established itself as one of the annual town highlights since its inception more than 10 years ago.\n\n“We are delighted to be part of it,” he admitted. “The running club approached us and we grabbed it with both hands. It is something we are delighted to be involved in because of the community spirit that is behind it all.\n\n“It’s a very unique run. Not only does it involve all ages and abilities, but it is the fact that it is a night-time run, its on an island, and it is a fun run as well as getting a high standard of competition.\n\n“There is an excitement and a buzz about it, and anyone I speak to about it seems to be really looking forward to it.”\n\nThe event has become an important fixture in the calendar of local runners of all abilities, from the serious athlete to the fun runners and walkers, but Ben, from Derrygonnelly, is taking the competitive element of the run seriously and hoping to draw on his running experience to post a respectable time over the course, although he was not revealing the 5K time he was aiming for.\n\n“I kind of have a target.” he acknowledged.\n\n“I have a fair idea of my abilities in it, but I do have a strategy.\n\n“I have a target in my head but whether I perform on the night is another thing. I’m afraid of witches and ghosts so I’m going to keep all of them behind me!”",

It was all a bit of a joke to start with, because a few friends asked what would I look like with hair.\n\n“I’ve always had a shaved head, because I’m going bald, so I think I will end up looking like Bill Bailey.\n\n“One of my friends set up a fundraising page and, before I knew it, there were donations coming in. I thought, there’s no going back now.”\n\nAdam, a competitive power-lifter, explained that part of the inspiration for the fundraiser had also come from his employment at Siemens Healthineers, the medical equipment manufacturing firm located in Sudbury.\n\nHe stated his work at the Northern Road-based company has continued throughout the pandemic to ensure hospitals have enough essential medical supplies available during this challenging time.\n\nHe added: “The support from everybody who has donated has been amazing.\n\n“The fundraising page only had a £500 target to start with, and we were over halfway there within just two days, and I’ve still got a whole year to go. I thought, how generous and brilliant these people are.”\n\nFor the duration of the fundraiser, Adam will be posting monthly updates online to keep supporters in tune with his progress.\n\nTo contribute towards the cause, go online to www.gofundme.com/f/adam-grows-his-hair-for-captain-tom-moore\n\nRead more: All the latest news from Suffolk\n\nRead more: All the latest news from Sudbury",

    "doc": "A MOTHER is furious that her severely disabled son was injured while being treated in hospital.\n\nJulie Maxx, 56, said an apology was not enough after she found her son Tyler, 24, with burns on his neck, shoulder and face as well as bruising on both arms while visiting him at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.\n\nShe claims staff at the Reading hospital showed a lack of care and understanding towards her son, who was born with brain damage, severe learning disabilities and cerebral palsy.\n\nThe Royal Berkshire Foundation Trust says it is investigating the “unexplained” injuries. Tyler, who is nicknamed “Tyler smiler” for his infectious grin, was being treated for a snapped titanium rod in his spine when Ms Maxx discovered his injuries on August 12, just over a month after he had been admitted.\n\nTyler lives in a flat below his mother in Gainsborough Crescent, Henley, and regularly attends the Chiltern Centre, a respite centre for disabled young adults off Greys Road. On July 3 he began suffering nosebleeds and chronic seizures and was experiencing intense pain when he moved.\n\nMs Maxx, who is her son’s full-time carer, believed he had a chest infection and after a week without any sign of improvement called paramedics who took him to the emergency department at the Royal Berks.\n\nAfter he underwent blood tests and an X-ray, Ms Maxx was told her son had snapped the rod in his spine and would need to stay in the hospital.\n\nTyler, who has scoliosis and requires the use of a wheelchair, underwent surgery when he was 12 and had two titanium rods placed in his back.\n\nMs Maxx said: “I was absolutely mortified because I wasn’t aware that these things could snap. That would explain the agony and why my son was in so much pain.”\n\nShe had begun to feel unwell herself and, anxious not to infect her son, left the hospital in the early hours of July 11. She remained at home for the next 11 days with a chest infection.\n\nIn the meantime, Tyler was transferred to a bed on the acute medical ward.\n\nMs Maxx, who has cared for Tyler since birth, claims there was a lack of communication between her and the hospital during this time, so she was often unaware of her son’s condition.\n\nShe said: “I wanted the nursing staff to let me know how my son was. How was he eating? Had he been sleeping? Was he comfortable? What was happening next?\n\n“From the bits of conversation that I could get, [I learned] they were all making decisions about my son without even contacting me.\n\n“I was so angry. I’m his mum, full-time carer and appointee. They had to speak to me because Tyler cannot converse with them.\n\n“They were doing their own thing and making decisions about my son.”\n\nThe hospital’s spinal team decided that surgery on Tyler was too risky and referred him to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for assessment.\n\nHe was moved to the short stay ward and Ms Maxx was able to visit him on July 22.\n\nShe said: “He was just beaming, we both were. We hadn’t seen each for two weeks. He was so happy and everybody said they could see it on his face.\n\n“His mood was brilliant because I was there. He looked really sad before I walked in.”\n\nMs Maxx had to cancel Tyler’s first assessment at the John Radcliffe on August 5 due to a problem with her van and it was rescheduled for a week later.\n\nTyler was moved to the Castle Ward, where he shared a room with five older men, none of whom was disabled.\n\nDuring a visit on August 8 with snacks and books, Ms Maxx noticed signs of distress in her son’s behaviour.\n\nTyler had bitten his hand and shredded two of the Postman Pat books he had been left with. Ms Maxx said: “I know my son. If he does that and bites, he’s not happy about something.\n\n“[It happens] when he’s not getting enough attention, if he’s hurt, if he’s upset or if he’s being ignored. Those are big distress signs to me.\n\n“He looked unkempt, he didn’t look washed or cleaned and his teeth hadn’t been cleaned.\n\n“When I walked in he just looked really sad, like nobody had spoken to him. Then I noticed he had a big bruise between his thumb and forefinger. It didn’t look like a place where they take blood. They normally take it from the top of the hand.”\n\nFollowing her visit, Ms Maxx complained to the hospital via email.\n\nHer next visit was on the day of Tyler’s rescheduled assessment when she arrived at 7.50am.\n\nShe said: “They let me walk right past them and find my son. Nobody stopped me and said, ‘Julie, there has been a bit of an accident’.\n\n“I got there and I put my arm around him and gave him a kiss on the head. Then I thought, ‘What is all that round his neck? All this white stuff’.\n\n“When I pulled the gown down, I could see he had really nasty burns, all bubbled up.”\n\nTyler had burns from his right shoulder to his chin as well as on his back and face, which had been treated with Sudocrem. There was also bruising on both Tyler’s arms.\n\nMs Maxx said: “He was in shock. He didn’t smile at me like he normally does. He’d been really happy to see me when I had gone before but there was no smile this time. He must have been in agony.”\n\nShe said she was angry when she saw the burns and bruises and shouted, “What has happened to my son” but was not offered an explanation.\n\nDespite his condition, Tyler was still taken to the John Radcliffe by ambulance for assessment.\n\nNurses there cleaned and dressed the burns and Ms Maxx said one nurse was shocked at the extent of the injuries. The assessment confirmed that surgery would be too dangerous and Tyler was taken back to the Royal Berks.\n\nMs Maxx said leaving Tyler that evening made her feel like “the worst mother on earth”.\n\nShe said: “I hated leaving my son there. Inside I was still full of rage and hurt and I was devastated at what had happened to him.\n\n“I was sitting there just wanting to pick him up and take him home but I had to leave him there on the ward where this had happened.”\n\nMs Maxx filed a complaint with the hospital and called the police once she got home.\n\nOn August 22 she gave a statement to detectives and showed them pictures of Tyler’s injuries.\n\nThe police have since confirmed they are not investigating and have referred the issue to the hospital.\n\nTyler was placed in Sidmouth Ward but has since been transferred to the respiratory ward after testing positive for covid-19 last week.\n\nMs Maxx said she had spoken to director of nursing Jessica Higson and renal matron Angela Clarke and was confident the hospital was taking her complaint seriously.\n\nShe said: “I am absolutely sick to death of disabled people having accidents when they are in other people’s care.\n\n“This is 2022 and the world needs to finally wake up to disabled people.

I thought I’d put him somewhere safe.\n\n“I’ve had quite a few apologies from people at the hospital but it’s not enough. They need to learn from this. This is serious.\n\n“It should never have happened and should never ever happen again.”\n\nSally Moore, head of communications and engagement at Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: “We are sorry Tyler sustained these currently unexplained injuries to his neck, shoulder and arm and we are working with our colleagues, including the police and social care, to investigate all the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n“Our director of nursing has spoken to Ms Maxx and reassured her that we will continue to work with her to establish what happened.\n\n“We have also assured her that our staff are dedicated to providing the best possible care to our patients and ensuring their families and carers are fully informed and involved in their treatment at all times.\n\n“Our investigation will include a review of the engagement between Ms Maxx and our staff to see if we can make any further improvements.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police said: “At this stage, it has been deemed that no crime has been committed.”",

We’re forever thankful to her and the rest of the EAAA team.”\n\nAt the end of the treasure hunt, back at the EAAA base in Norwich, Dr Chrispin was also reunited with a mother and child she helped to save in 2018.\n\nEmma Cavanagh, from Royston, was 37 weeks pregnant with Willow, now three, when she suffered a serious complication putting both of their lives at risk.\n\nBut after Dr Chrispin’s quick diagnosis, the mum was rushed to hospital where she underwent major surgery.\n\nMs Cavanagh added: \"She’s our absolute hero. If it wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t be here today. I wouldn’t have a precious family. She means the absolute world to us. We feel so honoured that we’ve been asked to be here today for her retirement.”\n\nAs well as helping to save countless lives, during her career Dr Chrispin was able to “kick the door down for women” after she became the EAAA’s first ever female flying doctor in 2007.\n\nIn 2016, she was also one of the first doctors to be formally employed by EAAA and in 2018 she became the charity's first Deputy Medical Director - a title she will hold until her retirement on January 31.\n\nDr Chrispin specialised as an anaesthetist and has sat on several medical boards across the region including with the East of England Ambulance Service (medical director 2010 to 2013), West Suffolk Hospital (medical director 2014 to 2016) and continues to be a Non-Executive Director at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for Safeguarding, Maternity and Children and Young People.\n\nShe said: “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with EAAA, proving that a small middle-aged woman in glasses could do this job back in 2007 when it was, at the time, a job mainly carried out by men.\n\n“It’s been wonderful and I am feeling very emotional about leaving, but I’ve done my bit and am delighted to pass the baton on to the next generation.”",

    "doc": "Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.\nPaying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.\nThe West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.\nBut it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.\nThe total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.\nThe JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.\nOptions for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.\nBath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.\nThe JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.\n“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.\n“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”\nThe idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.\nWhat new infrastructure is proposed?\nMass transit\nThe JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.\nThe network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.\nThe JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.\n“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.\"\nAll key routes within Bath will be considered, including:\n– A367 Odd Down\n– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol\n– Lansdown from the north of Bath\n– A4 from the east of Bath.\nBath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.\nBut he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.\nMany of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.\n“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.\n“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.\n“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”\nTransport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.\nNew roads\nChief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.\nIts inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.\nSouth Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.\nShe said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.\n“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”\nMs Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.\nThe plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.\n“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.\n“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.\n“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”\nThe JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.\nNew train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.\nSaltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.\nPark and rides\nThe JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.\n“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.\n“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.\n“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”\nA new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.\n“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.\n“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.\n“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.\n“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.\n“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",

Jamie Allen\n\n“So we’re hoping he’ll train on Thursday, along with Allen.\n\n“But we’ve picked up two or three knocks against Dagenham, and we’re assessing those.\n\n“Fair play to the lads, they’re rolling themselves out when they’ve got knocks and bumps, carrying on when they’re injured, so fair play to them.\n\n“We’ve got to try and look after the group as best we can.”\n\nWild says The Shaymen still believe they can finish in the play-offs.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nHalifax are 10th in the table, one point off seventh, but Eastleigh, who are level on points with Town, have a game in hand.\n\nThe Shaymen realistically need to win both games to have a chance, and will be relying on sides above them to drop points.\n\nWild’s men have lost back-to-back games against Boreham Wood and Dagenham and Redbridge, and visit Maidenhead on Saturday.\n\n“Of course we can, we can still do it,” Wild said.\n\n“We’ll have to work hard to get results, but we certainly can and we still believe we can.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n“We’ve sat down and had a chat as a group and we firmly believe we can do it.\n\n“We’ve had another excellent season and we want to finish off in style. We haven’t worked for 10 months to throw it away at the end, so we firmly think we can do it.”\n\nWhen asked what his side need to do better against Maidenhead, the Town manager said: “Play for longer. Watching the (Dagenham) video back, we were brilliant for the first 25 minutes, we played really well.\n\n“But we need to do that for sustained periods of time, we need to take our chances when they come.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n“Looking back at the (Dagenham) game, they’ve only opened us up twice in general play, and two of their goals have come from set-pieces, one on the counter, so we need to defend against set-pieces better and make sure they can’t drive through us.\n\n“So there’s bits. It wasn’t a complete disaster, but we certainly need to play better for longer.”\n\nThe Shaymen have won four and lost four of their last eight games, seeing them drop out of the top seven from a position where a play-off place looked on the cards, to it now hanging in the balance.\n\n“It’s frustrating for us all, we’re all desperate to do well,” Wild said. “If we’d had that consistency we’d have been home and hosed by now, but the truth of the matter is we’re not.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\n“Like I said on Saturday, when you’re down four players and we’ve got players on the pitch carrying injuries that are just trying to get through the game, that’s unfortunately where we are as a football club because of the strength-in-depth that we have within the squad.”\n\nMaidenhead drew 0-0 at Yeovil on Tuesday night, leaving them 14th in the table after one win in their last seven matches.\n\n“They’ve had a really good season, very strong, physical, excellent on set-pieces,” Wild said.",

    "doc": "Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.\n\nThe eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.\n\nThe changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.\n\nThe documents include details of:\n\n• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic\n\n• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:\n\n• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend\n\n• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock\n\n• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood\n\n• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges\n\n• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads\n\n• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.\n\nMatt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.\n\nA new bridge will be set up over the M25\n\n“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.\n\n“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.\n\n“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.\n\n“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”\n\nRead more:\n\nHighways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.\n\nBosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.\n\nThe consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.\n\nTo take part in the consultation, visit highwaysengland.co.uk/ltcconsultation.",

You are well lucky’\n\n“I think they were a bit jealous.”\n\nHughie Higginson at King George's Hall to see Liam Gallagher\n\nLiam announced performed the surprise gig to celebrate his latest collaboration with Darwen trainer designer Gary Aspden and also to raise vital funds for Blackburn homeless charity, Nightsafe.\n\nSpeaking about the gig, Hughie said: “It was such a fantastic night.\n\n“Because it was such a small space with not many people the atmosphere was great.”\n\nHis favourite songs from the set were either Wonderwall or Wall of Glass.\n\nWhat a night @liamgallagher a birthday Hughie will never forget!
