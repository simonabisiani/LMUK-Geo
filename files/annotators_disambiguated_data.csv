22,132901495,"A PLAN to trial the closure of a road in Henley town centre to support retailers is to be investigated further. Members of the council’s town and committee agreed to consider shutting Market Place once a month despite criticism from some members and traders. The idea was branded “bonkers” and Deputy Mayor David Eggleton said it would “kill” the town. Sarah Miller, who chairs the committee, first proposed closing the road from the crossroads to the Greys Road car park entrance, saying it would mean more space for events, such as markets, as well as outdoor space for retailers and hospitality outlets.

29,132901502,"A burst pipe in Hartlepool caused problems for residents who were left without water. Scores of homes and businesses throughout the town were left without water, or very low pressure, following the burst in Elwick Road. The road is partially closed and temporary traffic lights put in place while engineers work to repair the problem and several shops had to close for the day. Go here for more Hartlepool news and updates from Hartlepool Live The incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning and it was several hours before homeowners saw their water return. A spokesperson for Anglican Water said: ""Following a burst water main on Elwick Road in Hartlepool in the early hours of this morning some customers were affected by loss of water or low pressure. ""We have now isolated the burst and all customers will now have their supply restored and pressure back to normal. “Our teams are onsite repairing the pipe and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.” Christine Hall, owner of Elwick Road Barbers, said she was one of the lucky businesses not affected by the burst, but others in the row were. She said: ""It is strange how it seems to have affected some people and not others. ""Our water pressure was fine, but people on the other side had low pressure."" The 52-year-old said customers who live in various parts of the town had been in this morning saying their water was affected. She said: ""I had a gent in this morning who lives in Powlett Road and he had no water."" John Anderson, 81, who lives in the town's Linden Grove said his property was without water first thing this morning. He said: ""When we got up there was no water and then later it started to trickle. We managed this morning, but I couldn't get a shower.""

45,132901518,"A father caused a fatal brain injury to his baby daughter by shaking her excessively, a court has been told. Philip Peace, aged 42 from Dudley, is charged with murdering five-month old Summer in September 2017, and stands trial at Birmingham Crown Court. As the case opened today, Monday, January 18, a jury was told he deliberately 'intended to cause really serious injuries to her' because she had been 'difficult' to look after. Summer died at Birmingham Children's Hospital the following day. (Image: BPM) Prosecutor Andrew Smith QC said: ""At 4.08pm on September 8, 2017, the defendant Philip Peace dialled 999. His five-month-old daughter Summer was in a state of collapse. Somebody had sustained fatal injuries to her. ""The prosecution case is that Summer's collapse was caused by her being intentionally shaken by the defendant. Summer was taken to hospital and died a little over 24 hours later. The prosecution say that the deliberate and unlawful actions of Philip Peace caused the death of Summer and that he is responsible for her murder."" The jury heard that Peace returned from a family holiday in Wales on September 8 and was left alone with Summer at home that afternoon. But he dialled for an ambulance at 4.08pm saying 'something was wrong' with Summer and there were 'big gaps' in her breathing, said Mr Smith. The court was told that paramedics arrived within three minutes to find her 'unresponsive, limp, struggling to breathe' and with a 'very weak pulse'. (Image: Anita Maric / SWNS) Efforts were made to clear her airway and her mouth which was full of milk before she was taken to Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley where initial intensive care helped to restore her circulation. Peace told a doctor that Summer had started to cry and become 'inconsolable' between 2.45pm and 3.15pm, said Mr Smith. The defendant claimed he rocked his daughter on his lap, bounced her on his knee, and moved her up and down in the air gently. Peace also said he tried to feed her but she continued to cry and then she went floppy and collapsed, the court heard. A scan at the hospital revealed the five-month old had suffered brain injuries 'she could not recover from', said Mr Smith.

46,132901519,"A father caused a fatal brain injury to his baby daughter by shaking her excessively, a court has been told. Philip Peace, aged 42 from Dudley, is charged with murdering five-month old Summer in September 2017, and stands trial at Birmingham Crown Court. As the case opened today, Monday, January 18, a jury was told he deliberately 'intended to cause really serious injuries to her' because she had been 'difficult' to look after. Summer died at Birmingham Children's Hospital the following day. (Image: BPM) Prosecutor Andrew Smith QC said: ""At 4.08pm on September 8, 2017, the defendant Philip Peace dialled 999. His five-month-old daughter Summer was in a state of collapse. Somebody had sustained fatal injuries to her. ""The prosecution case is that Summer's collapse was caused by her being intentionally shaken by the defendant. Summer was taken to hospital and died a little over 24 hours later. The prosecution say that the deliberate and unlawful actions of Philip Peace caused the death of Summer and that he is responsible for her murder."" The jury heard that Peace returned from a family holiday in Wales on September 8 and was left alone with Summer at home that afternoon. But he dialled for an ambulance at 4.08pm saying 'something was wrong' with Summer and there were 'big gaps' in her breathing, said Mr Smith. The court was told that paramedics arrived within three minutes to find her 'unresponsive, limp, struggling to breathe' and with a 'very weak pulse'.

Peace told a doctor that Summer had started to cry and become 'inconsolable' between 2.45pm and 3.15pm, said Mr Smith. The defendant claimed he rocked his daughter on his lap, bounced her on his knee, and moved her up and down in the air gently. Peace also said he tried to feed her but she continued to cry and then she went floppy and collapsed, the court heard.

48,132901521,"A fuming Hull mum says she's ""sick to the back teeth"" of her daughter's school after her 13-year-old daughter was excluded following a row over her Primark trousers. Jessica Buckle, 35, of north Hull says daughter Maddison was sent into isolation at Sirius Academy North on Tuesday, November 3, - as a punishment for her school trousers - which she has worn for several weeks - not having a button at the front. After phoning home upset, Miss Buckle told her daughter not to go into isolation, and instead to come home before lunch, which led to the school excluding her for the afternoon. The school referred to ""defiance and truancy"" as the reason in a letter which was hand delivered that evening. Ms Buckle says Maddison has worn the very same trousers since the start of the school year in September, and does not understand why they were suddenly a problem after the half term break, as she accused teachers at the Hall Road secondary school of running a ""military school"".

72,132901545,"A woman from Ealing was a special guest at an exclusive preview screening of the new Black Panther: Wakanda Forever film as a thank-you for her support of a new NHS campaign to recruit more Black heritage blood donors. Siliana Coelho, 24, who is alive thanks to blood donors, was among 300 ‘specially invited’ NHS Blood and Transplant supporters attending the screening at Hackney Picturehouse. The NHS Blood and Transplant team partnered with the Marvel Studios film in the next stage in its ‘Not Family, But Blood’ campaign to encourage more people of Black heritage to donate blood to help sickle cell patients, amongst others. This is the NHS Blood and Transport’s third film partnership with Disney and its second with Marvel Studios following collaborations with Free Guy in 2021 and Doctor Strange In the Multiverse. Siliana, from Ealing, shared her story for the campaign launch and explained that she ‘would not be alive without donors’ and why matched blood is so important. Siliana was diagnosed at birth and she describes sickle cell as dictating every part of her life. She experiences frequent episodes of excruciating pain. Her worst crisis came in 2018 when the sickle cells blocked the blood vessels in her lungs. She needed an emergency red cell exchange and spent three weeks in hospital. The following year she shared a video of herself experiencing an agonising crisis which went viral on Twitter. Siliana was joined at Thursday evening’s screening by patients, donors and NHS Blood and Transplant partners and supporters. She said: “It was an amazing experience meeting all types of people coming together for one cause – to raise awareness of the urgent need for more Black heritage blood donors – while also reaping the rewards to enjoy it as one big community. “Great night, great people and more! It was also a great opportunity for people to find out their blood type and to spread the message about why ethnically matched blood is so important for people like me.” Zeeshan Asghar, Head of Commercial Partnerships for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “We were delighted to welcome Siliana to the preview screening as part of our collaboration with Marvel Studios’ Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. We very much hope she enjoyed the event. “By sharing her story about living with sickle cell, Siliana has helped to raise awareness of the life-changing difference blood donors make – not only for herself but for the many other patients who rely on matched blood. “We hope that the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever collaboration will help us to reach a new Black audience with this powerful message, and encourage more people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage to become blood donors.” The ‘Not Family, But Blood’ campaign generated record numbers of registrations from people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage when it launched in October. In the first day 884 people of Black heritage signing up to donate – the highest ever single day figure. During the first week there were 1,866 registrations from people of Black Caribbean and Black African heritage – a 700 percent uplift on the previous week. It is hoped the collaboration with Marvel Studios will further boost the campaign by reaching more people of Black heritage, particularly younger film fans who may not have considered blood donation. People aged 16-24 are especially needed as they are the donors of the future. The average age of Black heritage donors registering in the first week of the campaign was 31. The ‘Not Family But Blood’ NHS campaign highlights that although the Black community is diverse, one unifying thing is the power to provide life-changing blood donations. This thought is amplified in the people of Wakanda – different tribes, but together they are stronger, supporting and protecting their community. Ethnically matched blood provides the best treatment for sickle cell and more Black heritage donors are urgently needed to meet increasing demand. Hospitals in England now need 250 donations every day to treat sickle cell compared with 150 five years ago. Dr Farrukh Shah, Medical Director of Transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “The critical shortage of blood donations from people of a Black heritage means many sickle cell patients often receive less well-matched blood. “While this is clinically suitable, it can pose a longer-term risk to patients who receive regular transfusions. We urgently need more Black heritage donors to come forward. Giving blood is quick, easy and safe.”",harrowonline.org,Harrow,Ealing,Ealing

We very much hope she enjoyed the event. “By sharing her story about living with sickle cell, Siliana has helped to raise awareness of the life-changing difference blood donors make – not only for herself but for the many other patients who rely on matched blood. “We hope that the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever collaboration will help us to reach a new Black audience with this powerful message, and encourage more people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage to become blood donors.” The ‘Not Family, But Blood’ campaign generated record numbers of registrations from people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage when it launched in October. In the first day 884 people of Black heritage signing up to donate – the highest ever single day figure. During the first week there were 1,866 registrations from people of Black Caribbean and Black African heritage – a 700 percent uplift on the previous week. It is hoped the collaboration with Marvel Studios will further boost the campaign by reaching more people of Black heritage, particularly younger film fans who may not have considered blood donation. People aged 16-24 are especially needed as they are the donors of the future. The average age of Black heritage donors registering in the first week of the campaign was 31. The ‘Not Family But Blood’ NHS campaign highlights that although the Black community is diverse, one unifying thing is the power to provide life-changing blood donations. This thought is amplified in the people of Wakanda – different tribes, but together they are stronger, supporting and protecting their community. Ethnically matched blood provides the best treatment for sickle cell and more Black heritage donors are urgently needed to meet increasing demand. Hospitals in England now need 250 donations every day to treat sickle cell compared with 150 five years ago. Dr Farrukh Shah, Medical Director of Transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “The critical shortage of blood donations from people of a Black heritage means many sickle cell patients often receive less well-matched blood. “While this is clinically suitable, it can pose a longer-term risk to patients who receive regular transfusions. We urgently need more Black heritage donors to come forward. Giving blood is quick, easy and safe.”",harrowonline.org,Harrow,England,"Entity spans across several districts (e.g., a region)"
74,132901547,"A woman from Ealing was a special guest at an exclusive preview screening of the new Black Panther: Wakanda Forever film as a thank-you for her support of a new NHS campaign to recruit more Black heritage blood donors. Siliana Coelho, 24, who is alive thanks to blood donors, was among 300 ‘specially invited’ NHS Blood and Transplant supporters attending the screening at Hackney Picturehouse. The NHS Blood and Transplant team partnered with the Marvel Studios film in the next stage in its ‘Not Family, But Blood’ campaign to encourage more people of Black heritage to donate blood to help sickle cell patients, amongst others. This is the NHS Blood and Transport’s third film partnership with Disney and its second with Marvel Studios following collaborations with Free Guy in 2021 and Doctor Strange In the Multiverse. Siliana, from Ealing, shared her story for the campaign launch and explained that she ‘would not be alive without donors’ and why matched blood is so important. Siliana was diagnosed at birth and she describes sickle cell as dictating every part of her life. She experiences frequent episodes of excruciating pain. Her worst crisis came in 2018 when the sickle cells blocked the blood vessels in her lungs. She needed an emergency red cell exchange and spent three weeks in hospital. The following year she shared a video of herself experiencing an agonising crisis which went viral on Twitter. Siliana was joined at Thursday evening’s screening by patients, donors and NHS Blood and Transplant partners and supporters. She said: “It was an amazing experience meeting all types of people coming together for one cause – to raise awareness of the urgent need for more Black heritage blood donors – while also reaping the rewards to enjoy it as one big community. “Great night, great people and more!

The court has heard that there was a background of ill feeling between Constantine and the alleged victim which had resulted in an exchange of messages in the days leading up to the alleged attack. Constantine claimed that in one message the alleged victim suggested they arranged “a meet” adding: “No tools. Just you and me. One on one.” Constantine said he had wanted to meet the alleged victim to have a conversation with him and to get their issues sorted out. He claimed that when they met up near the junction of the A134 and Springlands Avenue between Sudbury and Long Melford the alleged victim had hit him on the shoulder with a hammer and he had bitten him on the nose in self-defence while trying to get hold of the hammer.

95,132901568,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. Lower Richmond Road Junction – The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. – The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension – The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council’s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: “The area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.” Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way – one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre – which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

96,132901569,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

106,132901579,"By Sian Bayley, local democracy reporter Big changes could soon be coming to the streets of Wandsworth as new plans for improvements along Putney High Street and Wandsworth Town Centre have been unveiled by the council. Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further £1.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community café. – This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: ""So many pluses have come out of the game. ""You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. ""And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort."" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: ""There are no easy games.

Pamela is a certified chartered accountant with more than 15 years of experience in the industry. Her strongest assets lie in financial reporting and analysis, planning, cost control and management accounting, with a particular skillset in upstream commercial arrangements. She is delighted with her new role as a senior specialist at the company: “I’m really pleased to have become a part of the Hutcheon Mearns team,” she said. “I knew that the company had an excellent reputation having worked as an accountant for many companies. “I work part-time and when I was looking elsewhere in the market, I felt like I needed to take a step down to find a part-time role. “I don’t feel like I’ve had to make that compromise here. “I’ve been off for the kids’ holidays in summer and have been working term time and school hours at the moment which is perfect for me, but I’ve also got the option to do more if I want to. “It’s varied, satisfying work in a senior role.” Andrew has worked for various listed and private sector clients, including Total, BrewDog and DNO. With a career spanning in excess of 13 years in financial accounting, he thrives at interpreting, communicating and interrogating new accounting policies and technical issues. Iain also brings significant value to the Hutcheon Mearns team through his vast working experiences with private equity-backed offshore supply-chain companies. Speaking of his new senior specialist appointees, Hutcheon Mearns managing director, Craig Hutcheon, said: “We’re delighted to welcome Pamela, Andrew and Iain to the team during an exciting period of growth for the company. “The enhanced experience of the team enables us to better support our clients with a turn-key team of specialists ready to provide short or medium-term support when required. “From maternity cover to daily operations, our specialist team require minimal training to integrate with client projects and deliver tangible business benefits.” Visit www.hutcheonmearns.co.uk",pressandjournal.co.uk,Aberdeen City,Aberdeen,Aberdeen City

Picture: Andrew Milligan/PA Wire Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the government to review RT’s license to broadcast in the UK, and the long-awaited report from the Intelligence and Security Committee accused RT, formerly known as Russia Today, of putting out “serious distortions” along with fellow state-owned broadcaster Sputnik – which has its main UK newsroom in Edinburgh. The former First Minister launched the Alex Salmond Show in 2017. Mr Salmond resigned as an SNP member in August 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he was cleared of in March after a criminal trial. A spokesman for the Labour leader said: “We completely condemn [Mr Salmond’s RT programme] and we advise the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to do the same. She should make a public statement condemning it.” During an Urgent Question debate in the Commons on the ISC report, former Scottish Secretary David Mundell claimed Mr Salmond was an “apparatchik” for Russia Today – a Russian term for a political appointee. “What’s just as concerning is the unwillingness of so many nationalists to call out this behaviour despite saying they have concerns about Russia,” Mr Mundell said later. “After the report was published we should have heard the First Minister speak out, so I now call on her… to condemn Alex Salmond’s ongoing relationship with the Russian state in the strongest possible terms.” And Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said Mr Salmond “needs to accept that he has been promoting a TV channel that has a damaging agenda for western democracy”. An SNP spokesperson dismissed the criticism of Ms Sturgeon, saying she had made her views clear on Mr Salmond’s involvement with RT “literally the day after” his programme was announced. The First Minister said in 2017 that “the choice of channel would not have been my choice”. “This is little more than a smokescreen to try and conceal the devastating criticisms by the ISC report of the Tory government’s negligence in failing to even assess the level of Russian interference into the EU referendum,” the SNP spokesman said. “If Labour and the Tories really want to move things forward perhaps they should be looking into unelected Labour and Tory Lords’ business links with Russia, which was one of the most serious conclusions from this report.” Mr Salmond was approached for comment. The Labour leader used yesterday’s Prime Minister’s Questions to distance himself from Jeremy Corbyn’s record on Russia, following criticism of his predecessor for not condemning Moscow’s involvement in the Salisbury chemical attack swiftly enough. Mr Starmer has said “the Labour Party is under new management” after he was criticised by Boris Johnson for not resigning from the Labour front bench over the matter. The Labour leader pressed for action against “Kremlin-backed disinformation” and suggested Mr Johnson should “look again” at licensing for RT.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'.

During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution?

It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing.

""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",manchestereveningnews.co.uk,Manchester,Knutsford,Cheshire East

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help.

""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",manchestereveningnews.co.uk,Manchester,Old Trafford,Trafford

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day.

""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",manchestereveningnews.co.uk,Manchester,St George's Park,"Bristol, City of"

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year.

""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. ""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said.

""To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. ""When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that’s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud."" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. ""I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,"" Simpson said. ""This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It’s something I can always be happy with."" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. ""You get to a point when you’re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn’t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he’s 37,"" Simpson explained. ""Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that’s me. ""Nigel is a top man and it just didn’t work. It’s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven’t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I’ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can’t just sit around waiting forever."" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. ""It’s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don’t do it,"" Simpson said. ""I’ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you’re on your own, it’s very difficult. ""I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn’t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn’t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) ""I was struggling mentally and there wasn’t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don’t have that relationship with clubs. ""You’re trying to find a pitch to train on. It’s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it’s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call."" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. ""I’ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we’re all in the same boat,"" Simpson said. ""We don’t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don’t really know about. ""Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they’re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. ""I want to keep training and I don’t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It’s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. ""You might have people that keep an eye on you like I’ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she’s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I’m sure that can help other people."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. ""I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it’s dangerous,"" Simpson said. ""I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. ""They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. ""Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there’s no proof. ""The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it’s not for me, then for others."" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. ""It’s difficult to keep going, it’s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,"" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . "" I’ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going."" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. ""I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,"" Simpson said. ""I knew I wasn’t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. ""It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn’t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. ""I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles."" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. ""I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,"" he added. ""I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans."" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. ""I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone’s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. ""I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney."" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. ""It’s the experience that I’ve got which means I can help other players,"" Simpson said. ""You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. ""Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself."" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? ""I’d say go because you’re coming out of your comfort zone,"" Simpson says without hesitation. ""Sometimes if you’re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven’t got your friends around the corner. ""You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I’d always say go for it."" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. ""Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn’t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,"" Simpson reflected. ""I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn’t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. ""I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. ""You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. ""It’s not really until this season that I’ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I’ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest."" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. ""That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,"" Simpson said. ""Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. ""I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. ""Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League."" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. ""We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,"" Simpson said. ""When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N’Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. ""Kante is one the best players I’ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn’t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) ""Ranieri didn’t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that."" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. ""It’s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,"" he said. ""After leaving a club like Manchester United, you’re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career.

He’s also likely to finish the season in the world’s top 50. But getting caught up in all of that, and his performances at the Masters and The Open, needs perspective. Mostly recalling what his goals were when he was starting out as a professional just three years ago. ‘It’s been a snowball’ “When I turned pro, I had set out a plan that I hoped to be on the European Tour within four years,” he said. “First year on the Challenge Tour was to find my feet, second year was to push for a Top 15 card and then third year to get it. “I did it all in one and it’s been a snowball since then. “It’s now really good for going forward. I have two guaranteed Majors for next year, almost three. “I am playing at the top end of world golf. I’m in absolutely the perfect position for where I thought I would be. “I didn’t think I’d be in this position so quickly, but you have to fight against the people in front of you. Right now that is in front of the best. That’s where I want to be.” ‘I’m too hard on myself, 100%’ Having all this within reach has caused MacIntyre to sometimes be impatient, quite naturally. But the ability to switch off and come home to Oban to be with his friends and family has never been more important. “I had seven or eight weeks with just one off,” he said. “It’s been the Scottish and The Open to events in America, back home for a second vaccine, back out to America. “It was a helluva lot of travel and there’s only so much one body can take. I’m too hard on myself, 100%. But I know that’s when I have to take a step back. “Go back to the Oban air and sunshine and just be a 25-year-old guy again.

173,132901646,"It was only a week after Joe Bursik had made his league debut that he was linked with Celtic and Everton. But such is the reputation of the 19-year-old Stoke City keeper, who has played for England through the junior age groups - part of the squad that were crowned under-17s world champions in 2017. Now Stoke have pulled off something of a coup by extending his contract beyond this summer and up to 2023. Bursik was 16 turning 17 when he joined Stoke from AFC Wimbledon that same summer as the club started preparations for life beyond Jack Butland, who everyone was sure would be moving on to play in the Champions League at some point. He spent last season on loan at Hednesford and then AFC Telford, in National League North, to gain senior experience - helping a push for the play-offs that just fell short. Telford boss Gavin Cowan told the Shropshire Star: “There’s no doubt Joe is going to go on and be a very top goalkeeper. He’s going to have a career in the Football League. At what level of the league that will be, I’m not sure. “But he’s going to be a top goalkeeper. You’re not the England under-19s goalkeeper for no reason. “Stoke have got high hopes for him and when you see him day-to-day, you see what there is there."" The next test has been League One. Bursik earned a move to Accrington Stanley, following a summer trial, and joined clubmates Harry Souttar (Fleetwood Town) and Thibaud Verlinden (Bolton Wanderers) cutting their teeth in the third tier. He had to bide his time for a piece of the action, getting a couple of run outs in the Leasing.com Trophy while Dimitar Evtimov, a former Port Vale loanee, had the gloves. ""It's the first time I've moved away from home and the first time I've lived on my own, so it was tough,"" he said. But a superb showing in a 2-0 cup win over Bolton earned him the chance in the league and he has played the last two games, against Portsmouth and Doncaster, as Stanley have picked up four points to claw up 17th in the table. (Image: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Portsmouth were brushed aside 4-1 - but only after Bursik's intervention when his side had been trailing 1-0. Accrington manager John Coleman said: “We had a setback going behind but I think a big difference is that, at 1-1, our keeper Josef Bursik made an unbelievable save and our confidence seemed to grow from that."" It was a nice way to mark a career milestone. ""It was massive, and it's a moment that I've been waiting for since I was a kid,"" he said. ""I was really excited more than anything and on the Friday night, I just couldn't wait for the Saturday afternoon. When it came I was just as focused as I would expect myself to be and I got out there and enjoyed every minute really. ""I didn't really want it to end to be honest."" And he is always looking to progress. ""You try and go where's best for you at the time and where you can get the most minutes to develop,"" he said. ""Last season I dropped into non-league which I'm grateful for because I met some great people and I learnt a lot of stuff about the game and developed a lot as a player."" Stoke have done well to keep him - and keep their impressive conveyor belt of talented young keepers, also featuring Blondy Nna Noukeu, another England youth Nathan Broome, Bosnia under-21 star Adnan Kanuric and Paul Cooper. He will spend the rest of the season on loan at Stanley, who are now two wins away from Wembley in that EFL Trophy. Indeed, Bursik was nominated for player of the round when he scored in a shoot-out win over Harry Souttar's Fleetwood. They face Salford City in the quarter-finals on January 21. Bursik is already excited about the future. He said in an interview for the Stoke website: ""The loan has been good, I've learned a lot. The first part was quite hard because I wasn't playing but I've managed to get into the team, got a few games in League One under my belt and hopefully I can finish the season strong and play as many games as possible. ""We've got a new keeper coach at Stoke (David Rouse) who has been in contact with me and come to a few of my games as well. It's been good for him to see where I'm at - and I've been speaking to Rory Delap too, who I get on really well with."" He added: ""It's a great moment for me, getting my second pro deal done. It's even better to get it done at Stoke, where I want to be playing. ""Everyone's goal is to play in the first team, play as many games as possible and have a good career and I think Stoke's the club for me to be able to do that. I can't wait to get going here.

""It's the first time I've moved away from home and the first time I've lived on my own, so it was tough,"" he said. But a superb showing in a 2-0 cup win over Bolton earned him the chance in the league and he has played the last two games, against Portsmouth and Doncaster, as Stanley have picked up four points to claw up 17th in the table. (Image: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Portsmouth were brushed aside 4-1 - but only after Bursik's intervention when his side had been trailing 1-0. Accrington manager John Coleman said: “We had a setback going behind but I think a big difference is that, at 1-1, our keeper Josef Bursik made an unbelievable save and our confidence seemed to grow from that."" It was a nice way to mark a career milestone. ""It was massive, and it's a moment that I've been waiting for since I was a kid,"" he said. ""I was really excited more than anything and on the Friday night, I just couldn't wait for the Saturday afternoon. When it came I was just as focused as I would expect myself to be and I got out there and enjoyed every minute really. ""I didn't really want it to end to be honest."" And he is always looking to progress. ""You try and go where's best for you at the time and where you can get the most minutes to develop,"" he said. ""Last season I dropped into non-league which I'm grateful for because I met some great people and I learnt a lot of stuff about the game and developed a lot as a player."" Stoke have done well to keep him - and keep their impressive conveyor belt of talented young keepers, also featuring Blondy Nna Noukeu, another England youth Nathan Broome, Bosnia under-21 star Adnan Kanuric and Paul Cooper. He will spend the rest of the season on loan at Stanley, who are now two wins away from Wembley in that EFL Trophy. Indeed, Bursik was nominated for player of the round when he scored in a shoot-out win over Harry Souttar's Fleetwood. They face Salford City in the quarter-finals on January 21. Bursik is already excited about the future. He said in an interview for the Stoke website: ""The loan has been good, I've learned a lot. The first part was quite hard because I wasn't playing but I've managed to get into the team, got a few games in League One under my belt and hopefully I can finish the season strong and play as many games as possible. ""We've got a new keeper coach at Stoke (David Rouse) who has been in contact with me and come to a few of my games as well. It's been good for him to see where I'm at - and I've been speaking to Rory Delap too, who I get on really well with."" He added: ""It's a great moment for me, getting my second pro deal done. It's even better to get it done at Stoke, where I want to be playing. ""Everyone's goal is to play in the first team, play as many games as possible and have a good career and I think Stoke's the club for me to be able to do that. I can't wait to get going here. ""I'm still on loan for the rest of the season and I'll keep working hard but when I come back here I'll be ready to go.""

180,132901653,"Judge gives carer suspended prison sentence over ‘significant level of premeditation’ A woman who claimed she forgot she had divorced her husband has been given a suspended prison sentence after falsely trying to claim his estate. Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by gardaí in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: ""Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. ""We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate."" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at €179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just €20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an ""opportunistic and devious way"". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: ""What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people."" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only €20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of €3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a ""significant level of premeditation"" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce.

215,132901688,"Lincolnshire County Council have confirmed that 95 per cent of primary pupils are back in school this week. Last month, it was revealed that despite schools only being open to the vulnerable children and children of key workers, over a quarter of Lincolnshire primary school kids were attending face-to-face teaching. A third of secondary pupils have returned this week compared to 5 per cent last month. The other two thirds are adopting a phased return to the classroom so they can be tested in a “managed way”. Attendance numbers are expected to increase over the next few days. Martin Smith, assistant director for education at the county council, said: “Based on data from Monday (the first day back), early estimates suggest around 95 per cent of primary pupils are now back in school. “In contrast, many secondary schools have adopted a phased return so pupils can be tested in a managed way. “We estimate around a third of secondary pupils have already returned and expect to see this increase over the next few days.” This comes as lockdown restrictions loosened for school children on March 8, allowing them to return provided secondary school children take three rapid lateral flow tests for covid-19 and continue to be tested from home twice a week. All pupils in secondary schools have been asked to wear face coverings in class or on school premises with all staff also being tested for coronavirus twice weekly. Parents and staff in primary schools, also have been asked to wear coverings, to minimise the threat of spreading the virus. Are you kids now back at school? Let us know in the comments here Mr Smith also explained that pupils returning to school gates had also seen rapid testing introduced at many schools across the county. He added: “Between March 5-10, 9,031 lateral flow tests were carried out in schools, of which only 10 were positive. All schools continue to use appropriate safety measures to reduce the potential spread of the virus.” That means just over 0.1 per cent of those involved tested positive. The lockdown in November 2020, saw over 90 per cent of children attending in Lincolnshire as schools were allowed to be open for all pupils, not just for vulnerable and essential workers’ children. At the end of June 2020 after the initial national lockdown, schools adopted a partial return. Almost all primary schools were open to reception, year 1 and year 6 children. However, at that time, only around 35-40 per cent of eligible pupils were attending. Last month, nationally 24 per cent of primary school pupils were on-site during the third lockdown.",lincolnshirelive.co.uk,Lincoln,Lincolnshire,"Entity spans across several districts (e.g., a region)"

226,132901699,"Mind you, I’m often behind the times. I regularly use Noughties terms including earworm and fashionista, as if they were zeitgeist-y. Goblin mode was voted for by 318,956 people, when Oxford took it to a public vote along with metaverse and #IStandWith and the winner was announced earlier this week. Apparently, this neologism encapsulates 2022’s trend towards being a slattern, or a slut, as my mum would say, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. Goblin gang The phrase has been around for a few years, but went viral, back in February, after being used in a fake news story about Kanye West and Julia Fox’s break-up, and even Elon Musk has used it since. Oxford defines it as “a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations”. It seems that lockdown altered our habits and, as the world continued on its increasingly chaotic axis, we doubled down into our goblin bunkers. This was in part a rebellion against the post lockdown pressure to go out and enjoy ourselves. It’s like being a budgie. They unlock the cage and unlatch the window, but sometimes you don’t want to fly free, especially when you’ve got some cuttlefish and a mirror with a bell on it. Also, there are cats outside and they might want to eat a pretty boy. We’ve watched gobbledygook on our phones, binged on junk food, haven’t bothered washing or styling our hair in the usual signature pompadour, stayed in bed all day, and relinquished any semblance of perfection. It’s an ambition-free YOLO of sorts, when you bin the bucket list and fill it with Häagen-Dazs instead. Your carpe diem has decided to carpe die. I’m certainly not seizing anything, unless it’s warm or edible. If anyone dared to ring the doorbell or phone, we’d growl “who’s that trip-trapping over my bridge?”. Or maybe that’s the trolls who say that, while taking a break between posting supportive comments online. Apparently, the goblin trend is a partial backlash to the images of perfection that have proliferated on social media over the past few years. The annoying sprites, who show us their green smoothies, perfect homes and shiny hair, are becoming extinct. Good. Don’t slam the cottage-core door on your way out. Even if it’s considered an ephemeral lifestyle trend, I feel that I’ve always been in goblin mode. Essentially, since birth, when I popped out as a tiny goblet. I keep up appearances outside the house. There’s the make-up and brushed hair, matching shoes and absence of egg yolk stains. I have a handbag that’s very smart from the outside, but inside – total goblin mode. There’s an unwrapped boiled sweet stuck to the lining. As soon as I return to my lair, the pyjamas are immediately deployed from their traditionally Scottish under-the-pillow spot. I used to have a strict 5pm curfew on that outfit, but it’s edged ever earlier over the past couple of years. That became permissible when they started marketing it as loungewear. If I ever have a night out planned, and it gets cancelled, my first thought is always ‘excellent’. I know I am not unique in that respect. There is no pleasure greater than having zero on your schedule. When the working day is done, you can transform into your true self – a gibbering blob. I think women especially are taught from a young age to constantly observe themselves, as an outsider would. This still happens to me sometimes, mainly when I’m in public. However, the indoor internal voice will occasionally pipe up. That’s usually to say “would you just look at yourself”, as I lie on the sofa, under a heap of mismatched clothes, with Marmite on my face and my specs smudged with fingerprints, so they render everything in Emmanuelle soft focus. “You absolutely disgust me,” they will say. “This is SO aspirational.” Sarcastic. As I get older, that voice gets more muffled. I think it might be buried under the cushions. Probably suffocated. What a shame. I’ll run and get my defibrillator. See, I can be sarcastic too. Since I am also married to a goblin, or a bogeyman at least, there is less household pressure to look presentable or do any Hyacinth Bucket-ing. As the only person in Scotland to like American football, his happy place involves eating nachos in a bobble hat and dressing gown while watching the San Francisco 49ers. At this time of year, the inclination towards our mutual goblin-hood intensifies. Since the central heating is so expensive, I spend more time in my bed, with the electric blanket on. I’ve given up trying to moderate my phone time, and my diet has gone to pot. Generally, though, I don’t feel too guilty. We’re sold the idea that a healthy mind and body is achieved through meditation, self improvement, exercise, positive affirmations and a nutritious diet. I do a bit of all of those things. They’re effective, if occasionally expensive, but perhaps being a goblin can fall into the self care category too. As Christmas approaches, I’d like to suggest we take it a step further, and go into Gremlin mode, except we WILL be fed after midnight. I predict a couple of weeks of mince-pie-scoffing and slipper wearing abandon.",scotsman.com,City of Edinburgh,Scotland,"Entity spans across several districts (e.g., a region)"

He made the bold prediction in 2012, after Rian and Ronan won an Under-10 competition, that they were future county champions in 2022. However, they went a year early and the three of the brothers were champions this year. Remembering the likes of his father and Peter Jones is a huge driver for the squad said McGovern: ""It is definitely driving people on and giving people an extra bit of motivation we would like to go and do it for them."" McGovern recalls how his father had high hopes for his boys and the club as they were moving up through underage: ""He used always go on about whenever we were playing underage football about winning championships and I remember he used to always say he would love to see us make an impact in Ulster. So it motivates us and we want to do it for him."" On Sunday, there is the chance of history for the club and for Fermanagh. McGovern is determined to do everything he can to help the Harps and alongside his brothers, Ronan and Rian it would be even more special. ""It would be brilliant. It would be a dream come true. I couldn’t even put it into words,"" McGovern concluded.",impartialreporter.com,Fermanagh and Omagh,Kilcoo,"Newry, Mourne and Down"
236,132901709,"Numerous hamstring injuries have seen him miss out on parts of the season, but he knows that there is a bigger picture, and that is the success of the club as a whole. Having come back for the Fermanagh Championship Final and Ulster quarter-final against Enniskillen and Dromore respectively, McGovern missed the semi-final against Clann Eireann. But he is back again pushing and he hopes to play some part in Sunday's final against Kilcoo and he is ""buzzing for it"". ""It’s kind of surreal to be honest. You dream of this when you are younger and you can't really believe it but we can't really wait for it and it would be lovely to go and make a bit of history,"" he said. Having turned 22 on January 10, it would be a nice late birthday present for McGovern as well. But he knows the challenge that lies ahead. In his fourth season with the Harps, McGovern has seen and been part of the evolution of this team and their impact in Ulster. ""There is definitely more belief. I feel we are all a lot more confident. The first few years we were going out [in Ulster] I don’t think we believed as much as this year. ""We believe we are the best team in it and we can win it, the confidence is there for is. We are not just going there to take part we want to go and win."" In 2019, Derrygonnelly came close to reaching the Ulster Final only to be pipped by Sunday's opponents, Kilcoo, who in turn went on to lift their first ever Ulster title. So McGovern and his teammates know the challenge that lies ahead: ""We played them before in 2019 and they are a serious team and we are just preparing the best we can. ""We are confident we can go and show them what we can do and hopefully come away with the win but it is going to be a serious hard game. ""We played that well that day too. They got a goal near the end that set them up to win it. But they are a very good team and it is going to take a big performance to beat them.""

263,132901736,"Philip Hodan is accused of allowing others to use his home in Longwood Dean Lane, Owslebury, as an operational base and/or a false alibi in the murder of Gurinderjit Rai on July 12, 2019, in Shepherds Farm Lane, Corhampton. Mr Rai was found the following day with two gunshot wounds. Four others have been charged with Mr Rai’s murder and all deny being involved in his death. The layby where Gurinderjit Rai was found dead The trial at Winchester Crown Court previously heard that on the Thursday evening before the murder co-defendants Aston Hannis, Charlie Statham and Paul White had travelled to the area of Hodan’s house. Hannis said that this was to find an area to hide a safe containing drugs. Giving evidence in his case today Hodan said that he saw Hannis’ Audi Q7 drive past his house. He continued: “I was just a bit concerned that his car was in the lane, thinking about what he had come for, so I got in my car and drove up the lane, made out I was going to the shop.” The friends met each other and stopped to talk in their cars, Hodan said: “I said what are you doing back here, and he said he was looking to stash some weed and I said I ‘don’t f****** do it down my lane, p*** off somewhere else and do it'.” Hodan told the jury that Hannis “mugged it off” telling him not to worry, Hodan added that he did not want that sort of activity near his family home. He later text Hannis saying: “Don’t forgot this time of year the farmers cut the hedges and s**t. Explaining why he sent that text, Hodan said: “That message was sent to deter them a little bit but in a friendly way.” It is the prosecution’s case that this was sent in reference to the burning of a Mercedes used in Mr Rai’s murder. Hodan denied this. Read more: The friends allege that they had made plans to go to Hodan’s on the night of Mr Rai’s murder to watch Amir Khan’s comeback fight, but the defendant said that White did not arrive until around 11.30pm, and Hannis and Statham around five minutes later, presuming that they had smoked a cigarette outside. Before they arrived Hodan text Hannis: “Don’t leave it too late though people start snooping” and explaining why he said that: “It was more of a message to say, don’t turn up too late as it p****s my neighbours off. It was more of a message to say that if you’re coming round come now or leave it.” The trio did not arrive until after the boxing had finished, but stayed for around 45 minutes, taking drugs. Hodan’s barrister Nicholas Tucker asked that when the co-defendants arrived “was there anything about their demeanour or behaviour that caused you concern or alarm”. Hodan replied: “No, just Aston being Aston, Charlie being Charlie. Don’t know, nothing unusual for me.” The prosecution claim that Hodan used his house as an operational base for serious crime, but he said: “No, the prosecution are wrong”. Gurinderjit Rai The court heard that Hodan took cannabis and cocaine but did not buy either of these from Hannis’ drug operation. He also denied being involved in the network. Hodan was also asked about a list on Hannis’ phone with his name and denoting that he owed £3,500, but the defendant said that this debt was from an unsuccessful landscaping business that they had launched.

277,132901750,"Philip Mitchell opened Chaat Man Indian Deli at Half Moon Farm in Rushall, near Harleston, in May last year and has since gained a loyal following. He now plans a series of cooking demonstrations that delve into India's street food scene this summer, with the first one selling out in only two days. Mr Mitchell, 48, became ""infatuated"" with traditional Indian cuisine following a trip to the southern Indian state of Kerala in 2003, where he learnt the art of 'desi' cooking, which means 'home-style'. Since then he has immersed himself in this style of cooking and went on to launch Chaat Man as a mobile street food business in 2016, visiting markets and festivals all over the UK before turning his focus locally. Mr Mitchell, from Long Stratton, said: ""After two years I decided to concentrate on the local area and began trading at local farmers' markets. ""As well as street food I started selling more fresh and frozen curries as well and after the pandemic the street food business took a back seat. ""People were craving restaurant-quality curries but couldn't go to restaurants so Chaat Man Indian Deli was born."" The deli has a revolving menu of over 150 regional and speciality curries to choose from, with over 30 available each week. ""I'm a one man show. I work six days a week"" said Mr Mitchell, adding: ""It's full on but for me it's not a job. ""I'm just doing it because it is what I love and the income is a nice side effect."" Chaat Man Indian Deli is open Fridays 12pm - 6pm and Saturdays 10am - 4pm and orders can be made online at chaatman.co.uk or in-store. You can also find Mr Mitchell at local farmer's markets throughout the year. His cooking demonstration in May has already sold out but a further one is planned on Saturday, June 11. The secret behind a great curry sauce ""Time, time and more time,"" said Mr Mitchell. ""Long and slow cooking is key. Real 'desi' cooking takes hours which helps the flavours develop. ""Using freshly ground spices for the masala is really important and not using pre-ground spices that have been sat in plastic pots for months. ""Also making use of the best ingredients you can get is key. ""Add your freshly ground masala to the cooked-down onions and garlic. ""Next you want to add the base of your sauce which can be made in a number of different ways depending on the curry.

294,132901767,"Redditch schoolgirl Jessica Field is only nine but she's putting many adults to shame with her commitment to the homeless. She was so upset by seeing those sleeping rough that she decided to brave plunging temperatures in a tent on her own up until Christmas. The youngster will start off by doing the St Basils Big Sleep Out on November 25 in a tent in her garden but is going a step further by sleeping out one night every weekend in the lead-up to Christmas Day. Jess' efforts have touched so many that she has already smashed through her target of £250 on her Justgiving page, but is keeping it open to see how much she can raise for the Birmingham homeless charity.

I feel sad for them and want to help them, I can’t believe some young people won’t be at home safe and warm for Christmas. ""I have chosen to do this because one night didn't seem enough when the people on the street don't have a choice to stop living that way and when young people are so scared of losing their home."" St Basils works with anyone who is homeless or at risk of becoming so and aged between 16 and 25. Along with helping them find a home, their projects and hubs give young people confidence to get new skills, find work and get their lives back on track. Brumwish 2023 - buy a gift for a child in need BrumWish 2023 is Birmingham Live's festive drive to get thousands of gifts to children and young people across our city - among them the homeless, the vulnerable, kids in care, kids who are poorly or struggling, and kids who have little. There are THREE simple ways to help. Buy a new gift from the Brumwish Amazon giftlist. In just a click your donation will be whizzing its way to our volunteers at Edgbaston Stadium. Donate money to the appeal fund hosted by Birmingham Thrive Together - this will help pay for gifts for kids with specialist needs or specific wishes Buy a gift and, even better, rope in friends, neighbours and workmates to do the same, then drop off your pressies at special gifting days on Friday 8th December and Saturday 9th December at Edgbaston Stadium, 11am - 3pm. Volunteers will be there to greet you and thank you for your support. Please don't wrap.

Making up the Brumwish and Toys4Birmingham gang are Birmingham Thrive Together, Birmingham Playcare Network, Edgbaston Foundation (part of Edgbaston Stadium and Warwickshire County Cricket Club), Birmingham Forward Steps who first dreamed up #Toys4Birmingham and BirminghamLive/Birmingham Mail. Thank you to Amazon UK and the amazing team at the Sutton Coldfield depot for their support. Barrie Hodge, head of fundraising for St Basils, said: ""There’s something very special about a nine-year-old thinking of other young people being homeless or in fear of being homeless and wanting to help. ""It’s not easy, November and December can be very cold months and Jess is truly brave and thoughtful to be undertaking this for us. Sleeping out from home is a great way of raising awareness and vital funds for our young people.” A Big Sleepout event for St Basils also takes place at Birmingham’s Millennium Point.

(See the list of new shops at the end of this article.) “This level of new shops is well above average and better than adjoining towns such as Godalming,” said Alex Bellion from local agents Owen Isherwood. He said shops with a service element which can’t easily be obtained online, such as food, were doing best. Shops offering “pure retail” were fighting against online competition and were in less demand. Town traders were sounding stoical but there was an overall feeling of resilience. Footfall is creeping up but, at around 20 per cent down from pre-pandemic, it was seen as a fundamental issue. Surprisingly, few shopkeepers talked about the cost of living crisis or energy prices. But Lucy of Solar Sisters said energy costs are high and getting worse and added: “It’s an extremely tough climate for small independent businesses. Rent is our biggest issue”. More traders complained about parking charges which were seen not as a huge cost but more a deterrent to shoppers. One trader said: “Some people are feeling the pinch now and looking at prices, but the high-end shops are doing well”. Bellion said there is good demand for shops “if landlords are sensible with rents” and added that rents had gone down by as much as 50 per cent in the prime, “cobbled” area of the High Street and up to 25 per cent reduction in the adjacent roads. He said demand in the out-of-town centre shopping parades was also good with few shops staying empty for long. Continuing the trend of the last two quarters, there are six new ventures in the process of opening or applying for planning permission for their new shop signs. A Carl Scarpa shoe shop has put in a planning application for the former Prestons jewellery shop in the High Street. Just up the road, Danish bakers, Ole & Steen, are hoping to move to the Ted Baker clothes shop which is closing on July 3. And yet another new bakers, Hoxton Bakehouse, is only days away from opening in Market Street. Other shops are hoping their presence will give Market Street the bounce Gail’s Bakery gave to Tunsgate. Kerrera, a craft beer and gin bar is looking to open in Jeffries Passage next to the haute-cuisine Indian restaurant, Ravis. A welcome addition to North Street, the engineered wood flooring and cladding specialists, Havwoods, will be opening in the next couple of weeks in the long-empty shop formerly occupied by the furniture shop, Wesley-Barrell. A new cocktails and cabaret bar, Fallen Angel, is due to open on June 25. Said to be the brainchild of Guildford entrepreneur and Guildford Fringe owner, Nick Whyscna, it promises “Drag, Burlesque, Comedy and Theatre as well as the best cocktails in town and the staff at The Fallen Angel are all performers”. Actress Jenny Seagrove is a patron and writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth is on the board. But whilst there were more positives than negatives, the difficult conditions for retail continued. Jack Wills clothes shop in the High Street is up for rent. Staff in the shop said they hadn’t been told what was happening to the store which went into administration in 2019 and had been bought by Sports Direct.

302,132901775,"Rishi Sunak departs 10 Downing Street ahead of the weekly Prime Ministers Questions Yes, the new PM had entered number 10 as the Tories’ ratings hit record lows but, despite their public insistence that voters wanted a change of government, cautious opposition MPs feared Sunak just might right his party's ship. Labour leader Keir Starmer’s reputation as a rather dull political figure had become quite the asset during the brief Truss regime. As she and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng wrought chaos, the boring man suddenly looked like a hugely appealing option. But how would their man play up against a new Prime Minister with a reputation for competence? Where Truss had exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis with her reckless tax-slashing agenda, Sunak was the man who - as Chancellor - had introduced the furlough scheme during the coronavirus pandemic. He might have inherited a party in crisis but there was no denying that Truss’s successor had a track record with some appeal. Starmer’s team recognised this and the Labour leader was at pains to insist colleagues did not allow themselves to get carried away on the basis of the polls. The Prime Minister, he warned them, should not be underestimated. I’m not sure that warning applies any longer. In just three weeks as PM, Sunak has all but destroyed what reputation for decency and competence he might have had. On the day he took over from Truss, Sunak stood outside 10 Downing Street and told us he would lead with compassion. His government, he added, would have “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. Since then, it has become abundantly clear that Sunak is a leader who puts self-preservation before all else. The reappointment of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary, six days after she was sacked by Liz Truss for breaching the ministerial code, was more than a clue that this was so. Sunak’s acolytes might have done the rounds of TV and radio studios to explain that Braverman was the best person for the job and that the PM believed in second chances but the truth was that the new Prime Minister had given her the job as the price for her support in the contest to succeed Truss. Sunak did not put Braverman back in cabinet because he thought her appointment best for the country but because it smoothed his path to power. What this appointment also did, however, was reveal an extraordinary weakness. Within hours of his speech about integrity, Sunak had undermined himself. Where was the integrity in appointing a Home Secretary who had, less than a week before, broken the strict rules by which ministers must abide? Of course, the Braverman appointment was not to be the last example of Sunak’s lack of judgement. Despite being warned about allegation of bullying against former chief whip Gavin Williamson, Sunak brought him into his cabinet as minister without portfolio. Troubling details of Williamson’s “style” soon emerged. Angry messages sent to then Chief Whip Wendy Morton in which he raged about not being invited to the Queen’s funeral became public. This pathetic behaviour was part of a pattern. Last Monday, it was reported that a current minister claimed that - while he was whip - Williamson had issued a “tacit threat” involving her private life while she campaigned on a “sensitive issue”. Later the same day, a further report alleged that, during his time as Defence Secretary, Williamson had told an unnamed civic servant to “slit your throat” and “jump out of the window”. And what was Sunak’s response? How did this champion of integrity react to these reports of disturbing behaviour? Why, he expressed his “full confidence” in Williamson, of course. A day later, Sunak accepted Williamson’s resignation. Sunak’s reckless decision to bring Williamson into government was the equivalent of handing Keir Starmer a bottomless barrel of fish and a blunderbuss. At Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader tore into Sunak over the whole tawdry business. The Prime Minister admitted his regret at appointing Williamson. Those Labour MPs who feared, just three weeks ago, that Sunak might prove problematic for Starmer needn’t, it seems, have worried. In fact, the new Prime Minister has managed to enhance the opposition leader’s standing. As Starmer questioned Sunak on Wednesday, his righteous fury will have chimed with anyone who’s ever had to work with a bully. Sunak has undermined whatever reputation he might have had for propriety and, in doing so, helped shape a new narrative around Starmer. The Labour leader might have struggled for some time under the perception that he was dull and uninspiring. Sunak has turned him into the energetic champion of decency and fair play. The Prime Minister’s woes are far from over. As this weekend arrived, so did new reports suggesting unacceptable behaviour by Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab. When it was announced that Raab had been reappointed at justice, senior civil servants at the ministry were offered “respite or a route out” over fears that some had been traumatised by his past conduct. Sources in the department said Raab had created a culture of fear, that he was demeaning, and that he was a bully. The floodgates are now open when it comes to revelations of this sort. And every new story about ministerial misbehaviour will further erode the idea that the Prime Minister is a man of integrity and good judgement.",scotsman.com,City of Edinburgh,10 Downing Street,Westminster

307,132901780,"Some 389 of the 1,760 patients treated for coronavirus at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn between March 2020 and February of this year became infected on its wards, while 151 of them died. The hospital apologised to their loved ones and promised to make the findings of an investigation into their deaths public. In the report, published on Friday, the QEH says: ""The trust extends its condolences to those who lost loved ones and those who contracted Covid while in our care during the pandemic. Covid rules will remain in place beyond July 19 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. (Image: QEH) ""We recognise that it has been a very difficult time for relatives and friends of those who died, many of whom were sadly denied the opportunity to visit their loved ones due to the tightened visiting restrictions in place to maximise safety, and some never got to say their final goodbyes when those closest to them were approaching their end of life."" The report says the outdated hospital made it difficult to prevent the spread of the virus. James-Wild-MP-urges-ministers-to-consider-new-hospital-in-Ki (1) ""Ideally, we wanted to keep any patient with confirmed or suspected Covid physically separate from other patients to minimise the chance of spread,"" it says. ""Unfortunately, QEH has a very limited number of side rooms and therefore regrettably some patients experienced numerous moves to try to minimise this exposure."" The report adds: ""Currently, only 10pc of our patients are able to be cared for in side rooms and restraints with the hospital’s physical environment posed a very significant challenge to the delivery of optimum care."" The QEH was built with an expected working life of 30 years but is still in use after more than four decades, with props holdings its roof up. An example of one of the 131 props in place around the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, including its kitchen and Rudham ward. (Image: QEH) It was not included on the list of new builds announced by the government last year and now hopes it will be one of eight further hospitals given the go-ahead in a new round of funding next spring. The report says many patients were subjected to multiple moves. The hospital appointed family liaison officers to keep families informed of their loved ones' condition and set up virtual visiting. But the report adds: ""While the trust took measures in March 2021 in real-time to respond to patient and family feedback about poor communication through the introduction of a new team of family liaison officers, for many we recognise this service came too late."" The report describes how staff comforted patients whose relatives could not be allowed in to see them as the hospital battled to keep the virus at bay. It says many felt ""they had not only taken on the role of a clinician, but rather a mum, a dad, a brother, or a sister when family members were not able to be physically present in the hospital"". It adds extra support was needed for staff who were experiencing ""extremely high levels of anxiety"". The hospital was the first in the country to carry out a so-called duty of candour exercise. Alice Webster, chief nurse at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Its chief nurse Alice Webster said: ""It's nothing less than our patients deserve. This piece of work is the right thing to do for our patients. We have to take the learning from this. It's about making sure we offer our community the best we can. ""There's no doubt the physical environment for the organisation is a challenge. We have a smaller number of side rooms than you'd want. If you were building a new build, you'd have more."" Queen Elizabeth Hospital chief executive Caroline Shaw Picture: Sonya Duncan (Image: (C) Archant 2020) QEH chief executive Caroline Shaw said: ""Covid brought unprecedented challenges to QEH and the wider NHS, however, there is clear learning from our response to the pandemic and from this duty of candour exercise that we are taking forward so that we can further improve the care and experience for our future patients and their families. ""This includes strengthening communication between patients, their loved ones and those delivering care, ensuring the management of infection control is everybody’s business and continuing to follow the necessary precautions to ensure everyone’s safety and prevent the spread of the virus and preventing multiple and unnecessary ward moves which during the pandemic often resulted in a poor patient experience and a breakdown in communication between the hospital, patients and their families."" More than 8,700 people have signed our Rebuild the QEH petition - you can do so here. We're calling on the government to look again at its precarious situation, and to think of local residents and the hospital's incredible staff, who should be able to work in modern facilities. By signing our petition, you can add your voice to the many who are calling for the aging hospital to be replaced. The situation at other hospitals The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital says that since the start of the pandemic, 2,011 patients have received treatment for Covid-19 at NNUH and have been well enough to return home. Some 693 patients have died at NNUH within 28 days of a positive Covid test and 129 patients died after definite or probable infection while at NNUH. The hospital says the duty of candour has taken place for those affected during the first wave and learnings from the second wave are currently being finalised. Professor Nancy Fontaine, NNUH chief nurse and director of Infection Control, said: “It has been an unprecedented time for our infection control and hospital teams with the huge challenges brought by a highly infectious virus and asymptomatic Covid transmission. “We are very sorry and our condolences are with all those who have lost loved ones over the course of the pandemic who contracted or potentially contracted Covid-19 whilst as an inpatient at NNUH. It is our duty to be open and transparent with our patients and their families – we are sharing our learnings and we are committed to making continual improvements. “Alongside a hugely successful vaccination programme, we maintain robust infection prevention measures, including staff, patient and visitor testing, PPE, extra cleaning and we continue to follow national guidance to protect staff and their patients.” A spokesman for the James Paget University Hospital said that during the year 2020/21, 90 patients died after definite or probably hospital acquired covid infection. She said: ""Our staff have worked incredibly hard throughout the pandemic to minimise the transmission of COVID-19 by following PHE national infection control guidelines. ""Our Trust is reviewing the details of every patient who died through probable nosocomial COVID-19 infection, and is communicating with their families and loved ones to support them, outline the lessons learned and explain what we have done to strengthen our infection control processes as a result. ""We maintain robust infection prevention measures and PPE usage, regular staff, patient and visitor testing, enhanced cleaning and we continue to follow national guidance to protect all our staff and their patients.""",edp24.co.uk,Norwich,King's Lynn,King's Lynn and West Norfolk

Read more:Bagot Arms blaze sees huge plumes of black smoke rise into Erdington sky Seven fire crews, including 35 firefighters, were dispatched to the derelict Bagot Arms pub, at the junction of Eachelhurst Road and Chester Road, in Erdington. There were no known casualties, according to West Midlands Fire Service. But after the second arson attack at the Bagot Arms within weeks, question marks remain over what will become of the building which is clearly not fit for purpose. In June, an arson investigation was launched by police after firefighters contained ablaze within a garage at the same site. But locals told BirminghamLive that the second was far worse. When we arrived the morning after the second blaze, gas workers were cutting off gas to the building, something which could indicate the ferociousness of the blaze given this doesn't seem to have been done after the first fire. Residents stopped to take pictures. One lady, who couldn't chat, described the sorry situation as ""inevitable"". A man, who asked not to be named, looked emotional as he surveyed the ruins of a former iconic city establishment.

He went on: ""The kids have got in and smashed all the windows. They have vandalised everything."" He added that he saw smoke billowing out of the building after receiving a call from his son. ""There were fire engines and ambulances everywhere, they did a good job really. It's the whole of the building,"" he went on. ""The fire in June was at the back. This one was terrible compared to the one in June. They [doused] that pretty easy but this one they were on it for hours."" He said it was a ""shame"" to see it in the condition it had been left in. ""People who I have spoken to said they enjoyed coming here at Christmas and getting together. And now it ends up like this. It will be knocked down won't it? There's nothing they can do with it now, it's too late."" The Bagot Arms has a chequered history. While a well-known and once-popular establishment, cops swooped in the Erdington pub in March 2019 and raided a cannabis farm that has been growing inside.

341,132901814,"The MoD Kenny Donaldson of Troubles umbrella group Innocent Victims United (IVU) was speaking as it emerged this week that an employment tribunal is expected to award as much as £560,000 to Bronagh Murray, a mother-of-two from Co Down. Mr Donaldson said while the comments she faced were “inexcusable”, her anticipated payout stands in stark contrast with the situation faced by many military widows. Ms Murray had worked for the MoD as a civil servant for 19 years, and her religious discrimination case centred upon a series of alleged comments by a captain at Thiepval Barracks during five months in 2017. Bronagh Murray described herself as ‘a strong, resilient woman’ who ‘was offered no support’ In one incident he allegedly stated: “I need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help”. In another, while discussing a concert event, he was said to have remarked: “I bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.” Ms Murray also claimed sexual discrimination over being described as “the big cougar”. Merriam-Webster dictionary describes the slang term “cougar” as meaning “ a middle-aged woman seeking a romantic relationship with a younger man”. The captain was disciplined and moved elsewhere as a result. Ms Murray retired in 2019, citing ill health linked to the captain’s behaviour. In a statement, Ms Murray described herself as “a strong, resilient woman” who “was offered no support and just left to get on with it”. The MoD has admitted liability, and her solicitor Brian Archer said: “It is anticipated that the final monies to be paid to Ms Murray by the MoD will be in the region of £560,000.” ‘SOME GOT £500 FOR LOSING A PARENT’: IVU spokesman Mr Donaldson told the News Letter: “The alleged harassment which Ms Murray was awarded compensation for by the MoD was absolutely inexcusable. “There were undercurrents of sectarian and misogynistic behaviour by the officer concerned. “We can fully understand and sympathise with Ms Murray’s sense of feeling let down by the very system she had given almost two decades of service to. We wish her well in her recovery as she seeks to rebuild her life. “This case has however raised serious questions around the level of the settlement granted. “We have been contacted by many, many families and individuals who feel that the losses they sustained were and continue to be cheapened in comparison. “There are many instances where the families of soldiers murdered over the course of ‘The Troubles’ were given compensation in the region of £500 for a child who had a parent murdered, with a widow or widower receiving £5,000 and less in some situations. “There are also 270 war widows who had their pensions taken from them by the MoD upon remarrying after their husband was murdered or killed whilst serving. “For many innocent victims/survivors of terrorism they feel that the injustices they have endured (and continue to endure) have never been adequately acknowledged, nor acceptable reparations or compensation provided.” Asked about the enormous sums involved in the Murray case, NI veterans’ commissioner Danny Kinahan said: “It is regrettable that this incident ever happened and that a serving officer didn’t uphold the values and standards that are expected of everyone serving in HM Forces today. “I will always stand by that most service personnel and veterans have always upheld the values of the armed forces including courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty and selfless commitment - and have done so professionally and without incident.” The MoD said that the tribunal is not formally a closed case yet, so it cannot comment. The tribunal service said that a written copy of the tribunal’s reasoning will be published at some point, but could not say when.

351,132901824,"The ZOE Covid Symptom study, a research project with analysis from King’s College London, discovered that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated are experiencing symptoms that could be confused with Hay Fever or a common cold. The three main recognised symptoms of Covid-19 are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to the ZOE Covid Symptom Study, those fully vaccinated have reported symptoms such as: headache runny nose sneezing sore throat A total of 33,874,176 people have received both doses of the vaccine in the UK as of July 5. Research has shown the vaccines help reduce a person’s risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19 as well as reducing the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Image: PA The first dose should give you some protection around three or four weeks after you have been jabbed, but you need two doses for stronger and longer-lasting protection. The study states: “The previous ‘traditional’ symptoms as still outlined on the government website, such as anosmia (loss of smell), shortness of breath and fever rank way down the list, at 11, 29 and 12 respectively. A persistent cough now ranks at number 8 if you’ve had two vaccine doses, so is no longer the top indicator of having Covid. “Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab. “If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, you should get a COVID test, especially if you are living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.” More than 45 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine and the top five symptoms have changed for those with one jab. These are the most common symptoms people with one dose of the vaccine are experiencing: Headache Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Persistent cough Currently, you can only get an NHS COVID test if you have a cough, fever or loss of smell. But you can get a test through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study if you log any of the known symptoms in the study’s app. If you’ve been vaccinated and start sneezing a lot without an explanation, the research suggests you should stay home and get a COVID test, especially if you’re living or working around people who are at greater risk from the disease.

417,132901890,"The former Charlton man is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Ibrox and could look to return south when it expires. The Daily Mail report that Rangers do not want to lose the versatile midfielder, but he could be prised away from Glasgow as soon as the January window. Aribo has made 116 appearances since moving to the Scottish Premiership in 2019. During that time he has netted 21 goals and assisted on 18 occasions. Meanwhile, managing director Stewart Robertson insists Rangers do not need to sell any players as he claims the club are moving towards financial sustainability. The Ibrox club reported a £23.5million operating loss for last season in their annual accounts. The deficit for the year to June 30, 2021 was more than £7.5m bigger than the 2019-20 campaign. Speaking at Rangers’ annual general meeting at the Clyde Auditorium on Tuesday morning, Robertson was asked if the Govan club, who won the cinch Premiership title for the first time in a decade last season, were closer to being financially sustainable. He said: “The short answer to the question is yes, I think we are on the cusp of it. “It has been a long road to get there because we know the investment required at the club. “Due to the support we have had from the board and the investors who aren’t here today and the investors sitting in the audience today we are now very, very close to being in that position. “We said in the financial report that we are looking to record a positive profit and that is looking very probable rather than possible and that is without a player sale. “I know there is a bit of chat in the press that we need to sell a player – we don’t need to sell a player. “What we need to do is get ourselves to a normalised position with a player trading model which is selling the right player, at the right time, at the right value for Rangers and that is something that again, we are very close to doing. “We are getting closer to financial sustainability, we can’t keep expecting investors to shore up the club. “I am also delighted to say that the statement within the accounts about us needing another £7.5million to get through the season, that is fulfilled already plus a bit so we are well-covered in terms of the finances of the club. “So everyone can be confident about the financial future of the club.”",glasgowtimes.co.uk,Glasgow City,Govan,Glasgow City

420,132901893,"The production and choreography provided by Anita Adams was well paced and full of humour providing an exuberant feeling throughout, whilst allowed the cast to explore their characters fully. The band under Adam Bonniface provided a well controlled and balanced accompaniment for the musical numbers, avoiding the much heard criticism of drowning out the singers (I heard every word). The story follows the life of Arthur Kipps (Alex Wright) and his childhood sweetheart Anne Pornick (Lizzie Wlodarczyk) as they navigate their way through life, love and the class system of the early 1900s. Alex gave a wonderful performance as he manoeuvred through the highs and lows of Arthur’s life and loves. David Kirk as the theatrical Chitterlow was suitably eccentric and full of life whilst never threatening to overshadow the lead characters. When poor shop assistant Arthur comes into money separates him from his old life and suddenly moves him into the higher classes where he feels an outsider. He’s never really abandoned by his old friends and they help him realise what he has left behind and he fights to get it back. The set was the perfect backdrop, drawing together the story from opening to closing scene. Brilliantly inventive whilst allowing plenty of room for the full cast production numbers. This was a true ensemble piece with too many wonderful performances to mention all individually, but they fit together perfectly like a 1000 piece jigsaw. The scenes were full of comedy, pathos and social commentary, I especially enjoyed the sculpture scene which was full of inventive fun. Some of the old musical numbers are still there, although with slight changes to lyrics, whilst the new ones add to the story. The production was one that deserved full houses, and more performances, but in this post covid climate it seems people are still reluctant to venture to the theatre in the numbers they once did. It is a shame as amateur groups such as Yeadon deserve our full support. They are the life blood of theatre often giving young people their first taste of the joy it bring both performing and watching. Shows like this provide precious memories for old and young alike, thank you Yeadon Theatre Company for providing yet another outstanding production, I look forward to many more to come.

A new cocktail bar is set to open above a popular Chester tapas bar in time for Christmas. Bar Gallo is opening above Porta Tapas on Northgate Street in early December. Porta Tapas owners Ben and Joe Wright, who are brothers, said they decided to open the bar to provide a welcome and warm place for customers to sit and enjoy a drink while waiting for a table at the tapas bar. Porta doesn't accept bookings and this has led to people queuing outside in the past due its popularity. But they then decided to open it up as a bar for anyone wanting to pop in just to have a drink. And they decided on the name Bar Gallo as a nod to the site's heritage as an 18th century tavern called the Hen and Chickens, but with a Spanish twist with gallo meaning cockerel. READ MORE: Chester's old Café Rouge venue to be turned into new restaurant The Hen and Chickens tavern was a timber building which traded on the site in the 1700s according to the Chester Walls history and heritage website. It was said to have been a favourite spot for people to get a beer while watching hangings taking place outside Northgate gaol opposite. The Hen and Chickens is thought to be an unusual pub name and seen as a symbol of divine providence. It may have been so called due to its connections to the cathedral, with pilgrims possibly staying there. The site's historic hospitality links continued when the present building was an inn called The Grosvenor Arms known to be trading around 1840, pictured in the image from the Cheshire Image Bank below, which is dated around 1905. (Image: Cheshire Imagebank) Ben Wright said the new cocktail bar above Porta Tapas would have a cosy vibe, with dark wood and reclaimed furniture including pews from a church in Chester and rustic terracotta tiles around the bar. He told CheshireLive they hoped it would be a popular new addition to Chester's hospitality scene, with a range of drinks offered including Sangria, Basque cider and a short cocktail list of classics with a slight Spanish accent, including vermouth or vermut to give it its Spanish name. Ben said: ""We wanted to create a cosy bolthole continuing the Porta vibe for people waiting for a table and then we thought that we wanted it to be attractive for anyone to come along and have a drink. We'll be offering a short cocktail list and serving classics with a slight Spanish accent. ""We've got Spanish vermouth - vermut in Spanish - and we'll be doing quite a few of those cocktails. We will be doing understated cool cocktails including some nice takes on classic Martinis and some seasonal stuff and wintery bits and pieces."" He added that they were proud to be a business based in such a historic city, saying: ""It's the thing we've always loved about being here in Chester. We are in a historic building in a location with a history of hospitality going back to the 1700s. ""It's great to think that people were doing something similar to what we are doing now back then. There used to be hangings on the other side of Northgate Street and this was apparently a popular place for people to get a beer and watch."" Porta Tapas has proved so popular that it has spawned branches in Altrincham and Salford, and Porta in Chester was named by popular UK restaurant guide Hardens as one of the best in the city earlier this year. Bar Gallo will be open from 5pm to midnight six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday from early December, with the exact launch date to be announced soon.

439,132901912,"This short letter posed the question of what would happen to all of the empty shops and whether, like the Marks and Spencers site, they would remain empty. Peter Swains' letter criticised the council's lack of initiative in ensuring that Bournemouth town centre can still ""attract visitors"". Many readers agreed with the letter and explained why they think the town is slowly deteriorating. The controversial topic of free parking was frequently touched upon, with many readers highlighting the high prices of parking in Bournemouth. Grace Hamilton commented: ""Business rents being sky high and parking charges are the problem. Personally, I avoid the town centre like the plague."" Steve Mcquade added: ""Take a trip to any retail park where free parking is offered, and the motorist is welcomed (e.g. Castlepoint) and you can see that online shopping is NOT the main problem!"" However, some readers do not seem to think that free parking will solve the problem of the high street's decline. Garry Mann explained: ""Free parking is not the answer as it will probably end up abused. Free parking on the weekends should encourage more people to visit the town."" Despite the parking in Bournemouth being a bone of contention amongst many of our readers, others highlighted the issues surrounding the town itself and how it differs to other successful high streets. Janice Lewis said: ""Comments on here are repeatedly citing car park charges and online shopping, but queues of cars flock to Southampton to shop! Car park charges in West Quay are high, but the car park is often full. There is a fab choice of shops and eateries (unlike Bournemouth). ""Bournemouth Council really need to start employing someone worth those expensive salaries who can inject some 21 Century life into the town and clean it up."" Rebecca Richardson also highlighted the significance of business rates, amongst other things. She commented: ""I like Bournemouth town centre! Love the gardens and love BH2, but I hate the smell of weed all the time and the anti-social behaviour. It's not a nice place to be in the evening. ""Cheaper business rates are needed to attract the big stores back as there’s not a lot left anymore.""

448,132901921,"This short letter posed the question of what would happen to all of the empty shops and whether, like the Marks and Spencers site, they would remain empty. Peter Swains' letter criticised the council's lack of initiative in ensuring that Bournemouth town centre can still ""attract visitors"". Many readers agreed with the letter and explained why they think the town is slowly deteriorating. The controversial topic of free parking was frequently touched upon, with many readers highlighting the high prices of parking in Bournemouth. Grace Hamilton commented: ""Business rents being sky high and parking charges are the problem. Personally, I avoid the town centre like the plague."" Steve Mcquade added: ""Take a trip to any retail park where free parking is offered, and the motorist is welcomed (e.g. Castlepoint) and you can see that online shopping is NOT the main problem!"" However, some readers do not seem to think that free parking will solve the problem of the high street's decline. Garry Mann explained: ""Free parking is not the answer as it will probably end up abused. Free parking on the weekends should encourage more people to visit the town."" Despite the parking in Bournemouth being a bone of contention amongst many of our readers, others highlighted the issues surrounding the town itself and how it differs to other successful high streets. Janice Lewis said: ""Comments on here are repeatedly citing car park charges and online shopping, but queues of cars flock to Southampton to shop! Car park charges in West Quay are high, but the car park is often full. There is a fab choice of shops and eateries (unlike Bournemouth). ""Bournemouth Council really need to start employing someone worth those expensive salaries who can inject some 21 Century life into the town and clean it up."" Rebecca Richardson also highlighted the significance of business rates, amongst other things. She commented: ""I like Bournemouth town centre! Love the gardens and love BH2, but I hate the smell of weed all the time and the anti-social behaviour. It's not a nice place to be in the evening. ""Cheaper business rates are needed to attract the big stores back as there’s not a lot left anymore."" Our readers also mentioned their preference of alternative shopping locations, such as Wimborne and West Quay in Southampton, detailing how they would much rather travel further afield than visit what's on their doorstep. Mark Holdgate explained: ""Depending on the time of day, I can drive to Southampton faster than I can get into Bournemouth from Corfe Mullen. That's before I even consider the issues of parking in the town centre. ""There needs to be better transport infrastructure between Bournemouth and Poole and frankly, we need more diverse shops as well."" Christine Lepine added: ""I don’t go to Bournemouth much at all - I prefer Wimborne and Ringwood, where they have more diverse shops and cheaper parking. I also travel to Winchester, West Quay and Gunwharf."" Many have noticed the changes to the town centre over the years, and do not want these changes to continue damaging the high street. Madeleine Murphy said: ""It's so sad to see how it has deteriorated since we moved here 17 years ago. It needs a combined plan by all agencies, council, police, community groups to push forward the changes that are necessary for the town to survive. ""Retail is changing and so will our town centres. The good will survive, let Bournemouth be one of them.""

Meanwhile the latest data available show that the weekly total number of Covid cases in East Ayrshire has increased slightly.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes’ silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe.

Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard’s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: ""This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch.

513,132901986,"now Picking up a wild baby bird that seems to have fallen out of its nest is not always the best thing to do, RSPCA workers have warned today, Last year, as more people were exploring the countryside during lockdown, the charity took a record 8,967 calls - five an hour at times - about orphaned, sick and injured baby birds during the peak hatching months of May, June and July. Advertisement Advertisement Hundreds of these calls were from Milton Keynes. But sometimes people may have been literally killing the tiny creatures with their kindness, A blackbird fledgling Today an RSPCA spokesman has given guidelines about when to intervene and when to leave a baby bird alone. ""Birds take far better care of their babies than humans can, and should only be taken into care as a last resort,"" he said. Around one third of all the calls (3,330) last year related to orphaned birds and another 3,252 were about sick and injured birds. The majority (4,611) were about fledglings (older baby birds that are starting to fly), which the RSPCA advises can generally be left to be cared for by their parents. Advertisement Advertisement The charity also received 1,413 calls about nestlings - the very young baby birds - who will not survive out of the nest. Nestlings are highly vulnerable and more likely to need help. Nestlings have no feathers The general advice is to avoid handling any wildlife unless absolutely necessary, always wear sturdy gloves and do not give baby birds or animals food or water. RSPCA’s Scientific Officer Evie Button said: “Our wildlife centres are now on high alert as the baby bird season kicks off. As well as handling thousands of calls - around 9,000 - last year, more than 5,400 orphaned, injured or sick young birds were brought into our four specialist centres. That’s a lot of round-the-clock hand-feeding, monitoring and rehabilitation of all types of young birds, from cygnets, sparrows and swallows to guillemots, goshawks and gulls! She added: “It’s wonderful that people want to do the best for our wildlife, but sometimes it’s difficult to know when to intervene and when to hold back. It is really important to ensure it is only those that really need help that are brought in, and in most cases, the best thing you can do for them is to help them stay in the wild using methods like re-nesting. Advertisement Advertisement ""If in doubt, our new, downloadable guides - one for fledglings and one for nestlings - are full of advice and can help to identify whether the young bird is a fledgling - which unless sick or injured, is likely to survive outside the nest without human intervention - or a younger, more vulnerable nestling, which will probably need extra help.” You can access the guides here. They help people differentiate between nestlings and fledglings. Nestlings are baby birds that have no feathers, or only a few. Nestlings won't survive long outside the protection of the nest and where possible nestlings should be re-nested and left in the wild, as birds take far better care of their babies than humans can, say RSPCA experts. Fledglings have all or most of their feathers and leave the nest just before they can fly, so it's normal to see them on the ground. Keep pets away, leave the fledgling alone and monitor, as the parents are usually nearby and feeding the bird. Advertisement Advertisement Even if you have already confined a healthy fledgling you may still be able to return them to their parents. If they're in immediate danger, place it in a sheltered spot a short distance away. In 2020, the RSPCA’s wildlife centres cared for nearly 3,000 (2788) ‘orphaned’ birds, picked up by well-meaning people. But many of these birds were not actually orphans and may have been better off left in the wild, they say. ""Unlike fledglings, if a nestling is spotted outside their nest, they need assistance. Actions may include creating a manmade nest, taking the nestling to a vet or local rescue centre, or calling the RSPCA,"" said the spokesman, The charity also has specific information on their website for some species which may need different types of help, such as gull chicks, bird of prey chicks and ducklings, goslings and cygnets.

514,132901987,"now Tears fell as mum-of-two Oryslava, who lives in Goosnargh, near Preston, was reunited with her elderly Ukrainian mother Olga Kogut near the Polish border. At first Olga, a 70 year old grandmother, had been adamant she would not leave Ukraine, despite the war and despite living alone in a flat in Lviv. But she made the decision to leave her homeland when Lviv came under intense attack from Russian forces in late March and she witnessed first hand the danger she was in. Oryslava and Ostap Anyonyuk collecting emergency supplies for Ukraine - they still need some termporary storage space in Goosnargh or Longridge for the aid donations Photo: Neil Cross Oryslava said she had pleaded with her mum to leave weeks earlier. She said: “I was planning to get my mum over but she didn’t want to leave, people in Ukraine don’t want to leave their country. She was like I’ll stick it out where we are.” But at the end of March, as the Russians extended their deadly attacks, things changed suddenly for the elderly widow. Oryslava said: ""There were two attacks on a fuel storage (facility) and a factory where they manufactured tanks. She had actually seen the rockets coming, she had actually seen them in the sky, and two minutes after I got a phone call – please come over and pick me up.” Oryslava Antonyuk, with her mum Olga, who has been rescued from Ukraine Oryslava 45, travelled to the Polish border. She said: “I didn’t go to Ukraine. I stayed in Poland and one of our friends took her to the border. She crossed the border by foot. She only got some essential clothes and medicine she depends on. I met her on March 27 on the other side. She was shaking, very emotional, crying. She didn’t want to leave, that’s for sure. She said I can’t keep on like that any more. She’s 70, she’s had two strokes. She had been there on her own. I’m the only child in the family.” From the border mother and daughter travelled to Warsaw, stayed overnight and got a flight to Amsterdam where Olga’s grandson Markiyan, 25, lives. Because of the visa situation in the UK Olga couldn’t come to England straight away. Oryslava said: “We filled in the application for the visa, the family scheme. I stayed a day or two to help her settle a bit. My son was working so he couldn’t stay with her. At least she was safe in his flat.” She continued: “We’ve been quite lucky I would say because the visa arrived seven days later, but it’s still seven days. My mum was lucky because we had somewhere to stay. If not where would she have stayed – one of the refugee camps? Then finally I went there and picked her up and got her here. Once she arrived here she said I’m safe now. I’m happy now. It’s a new place … I’m happy because I don't hear the sirens every night.” The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans Oryslava and her husband Ostap, 53, run a food company and owned and managed Eastern European shops in Lancashire and Manchester for many years. They now have a convenience store in Widnes. Oryslava said: “At the moment we are refusing to sell Russian foods.” More relaxed because she does ”not have to worry” about her mother, for Oryslava and Ostap the grief and worry about the war in Ukraine remains. The couple are both British and Ukrainian and Oryslava said: “Of course I do wake up at night because of what is happening at home. You can’t have a normal sleep now since it all started.” Concerns remain too for her husband’s family whose parents and relatives remain in Ukraine. The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans The family, including daughter Yaryna, 21, have been working tirelessly to gather and send aid supplies to Ukraine, supporting an appeal set up by the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Manchester of which they are members. The couple’s two children attended Stonyhurst College, near Longridge, and families of pupils there there have also responded generously to the appeal. But medical supplies, baby food and cash donations are still urgently needed. The cash donations are being used to buy food in Poland at wholesale prices for transport across the border. (For details of how to donate see below.) The family have been overwhelmed by the generosity of local people and those from further afield. Such generosity means extra storage space is now needed in Goosnargh or Longridge to store donations ready for collection. While juggling family, work and her aid work for Ukraine Oryslava says she is now looking forward to “a nice, quiet happy family Easter” which will be celebrated at the Ukrainian church in Manchester not this weekend, but next. For her mum Lancashire is in part a home from home as Oryslava explained: “We are in a very rural place with lots of fields and nice views from the house. She was born in a village as well with no street lights – pretty much the same environment.” The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans There is no doubt says Oryslava that as soon as it is safe to do so her mother will want to return to Ukraine.

At first Olga, a 70 year old grandmother, had been adamant she would not leave Ukraine, despite the war and despite living alone in a flat in Lviv. But she made the decision to leave her homeland when Lviv came under intense attack from Russian forces in late March and she witnessed first hand the danger she was in. Oryslava and Ostap Anyonyuk collecting emergency supplies for Ukraine - they still need some termporary storage space in Goosnargh or Longridge for the aid donations Photo: Neil Cross Oryslava said she had pleaded with her mum to leave weeks earlier. She said: “I was planning to get my mum over but she didn’t want to leave, people in Ukraine don’t want to leave their country. She was like I’ll stick it out where we are.” But at the end of March, as the Russians extended their deadly attacks, things changed suddenly for the elderly widow. Oryslava said: ""There were two attacks on a fuel storage (facility) and a factory where they manufactured tanks. She had actually seen the rockets coming, she had actually seen them in the sky, and two minutes after I got a phone call – please come over and pick me up.” Oryslava Antonyuk, with her mum Olga, who has been rescued from Ukraine Oryslava 45, travelled to the Polish border. She said: “I didn’t go to Ukraine. I stayed in Poland and one of our friends took her to the border. She crossed the border by foot. She only got some essential clothes and medicine she depends on. I met her on March 27 on the other side. She was shaking, very emotional, crying. She didn’t want to leave, that’s for sure. She said I can’t keep on like that any more. She’s 70, she’s had two strokes. She had been there on her own. I’m the only child in the family.” From the border mother and daughter travelled to Warsaw, stayed overnight and got a flight to Amsterdam where Olga’s grandson Markiyan, 25, lives. Because of the visa situation in the UK Olga couldn’t come to England straight away. Oryslava said: “We filled in the application for the visa, the family scheme. I stayed a day or two to help her settle a bit. My son was working so he couldn’t stay with her. At least she was safe in his flat.” She continued: “We’ve been quite lucky I would say because the visa arrived seven days later, but it’s still seven days. My mum was lucky because we had somewhere to stay. If not where would she have stayed – one of the refugee camps? Then finally I went there and picked her up and got her here.

I met her on March 27 on the other side. She was shaking, very emotional, crying. She didn’t want to leave, that’s for sure. She said I can’t keep on like that any more. She’s 70, she’s had two strokes. She had been there on her own. I’m the only child in the family.” From the border mother and daughter travelled to Warsaw, stayed overnight and got a flight to Amsterdam where Olga’s grandson Markiyan, 25, lives. Because of the visa situation in the UK Olga couldn’t come to England straight away. Oryslava said: “We filled in the application for the visa, the family scheme. I stayed a day or two to help her settle a bit. My son was working so he couldn’t stay with her. At least she was safe in his flat.” She continued: “We’ve been quite lucky I would say because the visa arrived seven days later, but it’s still seven days. My mum was lucky because we had somewhere to stay. If not where would she have stayed – one of the refugee camps? Then finally I went there and picked her up and got her here.

Jerry Spencer, Prison Director at HMP Doncaster, said: “HMP Doncaster has additional measures in place until the security issue from last week is resolved. “The incident has been referred to the police so it would be inappropriate to comment further at the moment.” A number of locks at the prison are to be replaced as a precaution to maintain security. Last week, an inspection report was published, which raised concerns about overcrowding, violence, deaths and drugs at the prison. HMP Doncaster, a category B jail and young offender institution, which holds around 1,100 criminals, was inspected last September. Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, praised the ‘consistent leadership’ and some improved facilities at the prison but said he was ‘very concerned by the increased levels of self-harm’ at the prison and referred to five self-inflicted deaths in the year leading up to the inspection and another shortly afterwards. He said levels of violence were higher than were noted at the previous inspection and he revealed that 61 per cent of prisoners said it was easy to get hold of drugs. The inspection found that around 700 inmates were doubled up in cells designed for one. Mr Clarke added: “This dangerous combination of ready availability of drugs, lack of any meaningful way to pass the time, and overcrowding will obviously give rise to tensions and frustration, particularly with such a young population. “As such, it was hardly surprising that at times staff struggled to maintain control.",doncasterfreepress.co.uk,Doncaster,Doncaster,Doncaster

They say that maintaining sovereign capability in nuclear fuel manufacture was essential for achieving net zero. The statement says: “We are increasingly concerned that the current ownership model is becoming a potential obstacle to preserving the site and the jobs that depend on it. “Westinghouse, the current owners, have so far failed to provide cast-iron guarantees on the future of fuel manufacturing at the site and have failed to bring in additional work either from their own reactors abroad or to fuel the reactors of their competitors. “Unless this situation changes, we believe that the government should consider an alternative ownership structure that will maximise the possibility of protecting the site and maintaining this vital sovereign capability.” The Uranium Oxide plant at Springfields The unions point to the National Nuclear Laboratory and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as potential owners. A Westinghouse spokesman said: “Westinghouse is committed to the UK and we are working with our partners to secure the long term future of nuclear fuel manufacturing at Springfields.” A department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Nuclear power has a key role to play in the UK’s low-carbon energy future and we intend to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next three years in order to strengthen our energy security, and create thousands of jobs across the country. “We recognise how important it is that we can manufacture fuel here in the UK and maintain a skilled workforce in the sector.",blackpoolgazette.co.uk; lep.co.uk,Blackpool; Preston,Spring fields,LAD not in options

541,132902014,"now Wheldon Infant School and Nursery on Francis Street in Castleford, was broken into in the early evening of Wednesday, October 5 with the intruder setting fire to their outdoor learning area, completely destroying everything from the wooden hut to children’s wellies. School office manager, Vikki Till, said: “We are all so upset. Whoever did this set fire to everything – even the children’s wellies and waterproof overalls were thrown on the fire. ""It’s so upsetting for staff and pupils. We held an assembly on Friday morning to explain to the children what has happened.” Pupils and staff at Wheldon Infant School & Nursery were devastated after their school was broken into and their outdoor forest classroom was burnt down. The Forest School is an outdoor, timetabled resource that the whole school uses for outdoor education. Vikki said: “There was a hut with a roof and a bench and table, so, regardless of the weather, children were able to learn outdoors. They took part in things like bug hunts and story time. ""It was always the highlight of their week. They all loved it and now it’s been totally destroyed. ""It had taken around five years to get it set up and at a cost of around £10,000 with all the landscaping, furniture and resources. The area was completely destroyed. ""The children are so upset and all the staff are all devastated. ""The sad thing is, whoever did this hasn’t just damaged the hut and the furniture, they’ve also thrown the children’s wellies and waterproof overalls into the fire. ""It’s not as though it was just someone who was walking past and broken in. It’s a dead-end street – they've come in with some level of intent. ""They know it’s a school, they know what they were taking away from the children.” Chair of Governors John Hanson. Determined to rebuild, Vikki said the response the school has had from parents and the local community as a whole has been overwhelming. ""We’ve had parents, businesses and landscapers all getting in touch with us offering their help. We’re genuinely blown away by the generosity of people,” she said. ""The community has been so quick to respond. Everyone is feeling the pinch at the moment, but they are offering their materials, their time.” The school is now assessing the damage, taking stock of what has been lost, making the area safe again and seeing if any of the damaged trees are salvageable or have to be taken down. The school is assessing the damage caused. “We will rebuild it as soon as possible for the children, but there is a certain level of apprehension – will the culprit come back? Should we install CCTV? “It’s something we now have to think about, but it’s all an added expense. Our budget should be spent on pupils’ learning, not on unnecessary repairs.",wakefieldexpress.co.uk,Wakefield,Castleford,Wakefield
