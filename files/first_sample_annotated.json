            "doc": "It was only a week after Joe Bursik had made his league debut that he was linked with Celtic and Everton. But such is the reputation of the 19-year-old Stoke City keeper, who has played for England through the junior age groups - part of the squad that were crowned under-17s world champions in 2017. Now Stoke have pulled off something of a coup by extending his contract beyond this summer and up to 2023. Bursik was 16 turning 17 when he joined Stoke from AFC Wimbledon that same summer as the club started preparations for life beyond Jack Butland, who everyone was sure would be moving on to play in the Champions League at some point. He spent last season on loan at Hednesford and then AFC Telford, in National League North, to gain senior experience - helping a push for the play-offs that just fell short. Telford boss Gavin Cowan told the Shropshire Star: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Joe is going to go on and be a very top goalkeeper. He\u2019s going to have a career in the Football League. At what level of the league that will be, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be a top goalkeeper. You\u2019re not the England under-19s goalkeeper for no reason. \u201cStoke have got high hopes for him and when you see him day-to-day, you see what there is there.\" The next test has been League One. Bursik earned a move to Accrington Stanley, following a summer trial, and joined clubmates Harry Souttar (Fleetwood Town) and Thibaud Verlinden (Bolton Wanderers) cutting their teeth in the third tier. He had to bide his time for a piece of the action, getting a couple of run outs in the Leasing.com Trophy while Dimitar Evtimov, a former Port Vale loanee, had the gloves. \"It's the first time I've moved away from home and the first time I've lived on my own, so it was tough,\" he said. But a superb showing in a 2-0 cup win over Bolton earned him the chance in the league and he has played the last two games, against Portsmouth and Doncaster, as Stanley have picked up four points to claw up 17th in the table. (Image: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Portsmouth were brushed aside 4-1 - but only after Bursik's intervention when his side had been trailing 1-0. Accrington manager John Coleman said: \u201cWe had a setback going behind but I think a big difference is that, at 1-1, our keeper Josef Bursik made an unbelievable save and our confidence seemed to grow from that.\" It was a nice way to mark a career milestone. \"It was massive, and it's a moment that I've been waiting for since I was a kid,\" he said. \"I was really excited more than anything and on the Friday night, I just couldn't wait for the Saturday afternoon. When it came I was just as focused as I would expect myself to be and I got out there and enjoyed every minute really. \"I didn't really want it to end to be honest.\" And he is always looking to progress. \"You try and go where's best for you at the time and where you can get the most minutes to develop,\" he said. \"Last season I dropped into non-league which I'm grateful for because I met some great people and I learnt a lot of stuff about the game and developed a lot as a player.\" Stoke have done well to keep him - and keep their impressive conveyor belt of talented young keepers, also featuring Blondy Nna Noukeu, another England youth Nathan Broome, Bosnia under-21 star Adnan Kanuric and Paul Cooper. He will spend the rest of the season on loan at Stanley, who are now two wins away from Wembley in that EFL Trophy. Indeed, Bursik was nominated for player of the round when he scored in a shoot-out win over Harry Souttar's Fleetwood. They face Salford City in the quarter-finals on January 21. Bursik is already excited about the future. He said in an interview for the Stoke website: \"The loan has been good, I've learned a lot. The first part was quite hard because I wasn't playing but I've managed to get into the team, got a few games in League One under my belt and hopefully I can finish the season strong and play as many games as possible. \"We've got a new keeper coach at Stoke (David Rouse) who has been in contact with me and come to a few of my games as well. It's been good for him to see where I'm at - and I've been speaking to Rory Delap too, who I get on really well with.\" He added: \"It's a great moment for me, getting my second pro deal done. It's even better to get it done at Stoke, where I want to be playing. \"Everyone's goal is to play in the first team, play as many games as possible and have a good career and I think Stoke's the club for me to be able to do that. I can't wait to get going here. \"I'm still on loan for the rest of the season and I'll keep working hard but when I come back here I'll be ready to go.\" StokeonTrentLive has launched a WhatsApp service dedicated to keeping you up to date with the latest Stoke City news!

                        "doc": "It was only a week after Joe Bursik had made his league debut that he was linked with Celtic and Everton. But such is the reputation of the 19-year-old Stoke City keeper, who has played for England through the junior age groups - part of the squad that were crowned under-17s world champions in 2017. Now Stoke have pulled off something of a coup by extending his contract beyond this summer and up to 2023. Bursik was 16 turning 17 when he joined Stoke from AFC Wimbledon that same summer as the club started preparations for life beyond Jack Butland, who everyone was sure would be moving on to play in the Champions League at some point. He spent last season on loan at Hednesford and then AFC Telford, in National League North, to gain senior experience - helping a push for the play-offs that just fell short. Telford boss Gavin Cowan told the Shropshire Star: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Joe is going to go on and be a very top goalkeeper. He\u2019s going to have a career in the Football League. At what level of the league that will be, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be a top goalkeeper. You\u2019re not the England under-19s goalkeeper for no reason. \u201cStoke have got high hopes for him and when you see him day-to-day, you see what there is there.\" The next test has been League One. Bursik earned a move to Accrington Stanley, following a summer trial, and joined clubmates Harry Souttar (Fleetwood Town) and Thibaud Verlinden (Bolton Wanderers) cutting their teeth in the third tier. He had to bide his time for a piece of the action, getting a couple of run outs in the Leasing.com Trophy while Dimitar Evtimov, a former Port Vale loanee, had the gloves. \"It's the first time I've moved away from home and the first time I've lived on my own, so it was tough,\" he said. But a superb showing in a 2-0 cup win over Bolton earned him the chance in the league and he has played the last two games, against Portsmouth and Doncaster, as Stanley have picked up four points to claw up 17th in the table. (Image: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Portsmouth were brushed aside 4-1 - but only after Bursik's intervention when his side had been trailing 1-0. Accrington manager John Coleman said: \u201cWe had a setback going behind but I think a big difference is that, at 1-1, our keeper Josef Bursik made an unbelievable save and our confidence seemed to grow from that.\" It was a nice way to mark a career milestone. \"It was massive, and it's a moment that I've been waiting for since I was a kid,\" he said. \"I was really excited more than anything and on the Friday night, I just couldn't wait for the Saturday afternoon. When it came I was just as focused as I would expect myself to be and I got out there and enjoyed every minute really. \"I didn't really want it to end to be honest.\" And he is always looking to progress. \"You try and go where's best for you at the time and where you can get the most minutes to develop,\" he said. \"Last season I dropped into non-league which I'm grateful for because I met some great people and I learnt a lot of stuff about the game and developed a lot as a player.\" Stoke have done well to keep him - and keep their impressive conveyor belt of talented young keepers, also featuring Blondy Nna Noukeu, another England youth Nathan Broome, Bosnia under-21 star Adnan Kanuric and Paul Cooper. He will spend the rest of the season on loan at Stanley, who are now two wins away from Wembley in that EFL Trophy. Indeed, Bursik was nominated for player of the round when he scored in a shoot-out win over Harry Souttar's Fleetwood. They face Salford City in the quarter-finals on January 21. Bursik is already excited about the future. He said in an interview for the Stoke website: \"The loan has been good, I've learned a lot. The first part was quite hard because I wasn't playing but I've managed to get into the team, got a few games in League One under my belt and hopefully I can finish the season strong and play as many games as possible. \"We've got a new keeper coach at Stoke (David Rouse) who has been in contact with me and come to a few of my games as well. It's been good for him to see where I'm at - and I've been speaking to Rory Delap too, who I get on really well with.\" He added: \"It's a great moment for me, getting my second pro deal done. It's even better to get it done at Stoke, where I want to be playing. \"Everyone's goal is to play in the first team, play as many games as possible and have a good career and I think Stoke's the club for me to be able to do that. I can't wait to get going here. \"I'm still on loan for the rest of the season and I'll keep working hard but when I come back here I'll be ready to go.\" StokeonTrentLive has launched a WhatsApp service dedicated to keeping you up to date with the latest Stoke City news!

These relationships will enhance the problem solving capabilities of police by encompassing local input, to reduce crime in the area and provide reassurance to the local community and its visitors. We will of course continue to work with British Transport Police and TfL on match days for the protection of those using the local transport hubs. A dedicated team for the development at Wembley Park; which boasts housing, retail, bars and restaurants, has been established as a longer-term approach to the safety of residents and visitors to the area. This team will work later into the evenings with more of a focus on tackling anti-social behaviour. The officers and staff of North West Basic Command Unit (NW BCU) will strive to do everything we can to ensure the ongoing safety of those living in, working in, or visiting Wembley.",

Philip Peace, aged 42 from Dudley, is charged with murdering five-month old Summer in September 2017, and stands trial at Birmingham Crown Court. As the case opened today, Monday, January 18, a jury was told he deliberately 'intended to cause really serious injuries to her' because she had been 'difficult' to look after. Summer died at Birmingham Children's Hospital the following day. (Image: BPM) Prosecutor Andrew Smith QC said: \"At 4.08pm on September 8, 2017, the defendant Philip Peace dialled 999. His five-month-old daughter Summer was in a state of collapse. Somebody had sustained fatal injuries to her. \"The prosecution case is that Summer's collapse was caused by her being intentionally shaken by the defendant. Summer was taken to hospital and died a little over 24 hours later. The prosecution say that the deliberate and unlawful actions of Philip Peace caused the death of Summer and that he is responsible for her murder.\" The jury heard that Peace returned from a family holiday in Wales on September 8 and was left alone with Summer at home that afternoon. But he dialled for an ambulance at 4.08pm saying 'something was wrong' with Summer and there were 'big gaps' in her breathing, said Mr Smith. The court was told that paramedics arrived within three minutes to find her 'unresponsive, limp, struggling to breathe' and with a 'very weak pulse'. (Image: Anita Maric / SWNS) Efforts were made to clear her airway and her mouth which was full of milk before she was taken to Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley where initial intensive care helped to restore her circulation. Peace told a doctor that Summer had started to cry and become 'inconsolable' between 2.45pm and 3.15pm, said Mr Smith. The defendant claimed he rocked his daughter on his lap, bounced her on his knee, and moved her up and down in the air gently. Peace also said he tried to feed her but she continued to cry and then she went floppy and collapsed, the court heard. A scan at the hospital revealed the five-month old had suffered brain injuries 'she could not recover from', said Mr Smith. The prosecutor stated Summer was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital but deteriorated and with the agreement of her parents her life support was turned off. She died at 5.44pm on September 9. The court heard Peace was later arrested and denied shaking Summer as well as 'losing control'. Mr Smith said: \"Mr Peace will maintain that position during this trial, that's to say he does not bear any criminal responsibility for Summer's death. The prosecution say Mr Peace's account does not explain Summer's collapse and her suffering fatal injuries.\" The jury was told she also suffered bruises to her arm and chest, 11 rib fractures and one fracture to her sternum, as well as pneumonia. Mr Smith stated her medical cause of death was her head injuries which he stated was brought on by a 'traumatic event'. He added: \"Mr Peace conceded in interview Summer had been difficult to look after that afternoon. \"The nature of the cause of Summer's fatal collapse is a significant indication together with the presence of multiple fractures that the defendant intended at the very least to cause really serious injuries to her.\" Peace of Himley Road, Dudley, denies murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. The trial continues."

The court was told that paramedics arrived within three minutes to find her 'unresponsive, limp, struggling to breathe' and with a 'very weak pulse'. (Image: Anita Maric / SWNS) Efforts were made to clear her airway and her mouth which was full of milk before she was taken to Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley where initial intensive care helped to restore her circulation. Peace told a doctor that Summer had started to cry and become 'inconsolable' between 2.45pm and 3.15pm, said Mr Smith. The defendant claimed he rocked his daughter on his lap, bounced her on his knee, and moved her up and down in the air gently. Peace also said he tried to feed her but she continued to cry and then she went floppy and collapsed, the court heard. A scan at the hospital revealed the five-month old had suffered brain injuries 'she could not recover from', said Mr Smith. The prosecutor stated Summer was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital but deteriorated and with the agreement of her parents her life support was turned off. She died at 5.44pm on September 9. The court heard Peace was later arrested and denied shaking Summer as well as 'losing control'. Mr Smith said: \"Mr Peace will maintain that position during this trial, that's to say he does not bear any criminal responsibility for Summer's death. The prosecution say Mr Peace's account does not explain Summer's collapse and her suffering fatal injuries.\" The jury was told she also suffered bruises to her arm and chest, 11 rib fractures and one fracture to her sternum, as well as pneumonia. Mr Smith stated her medical cause of death was her head injuries which he stated was brought on by a 'traumatic event'. He added: \"Mr Peace conceded in interview Summer had been difficult to look after that afternoon. \"The nature of the cause of Summer's fatal collapse is a significant indication together with the presence of multiple fractures that the defendant intended at the very least to cause really serious injuries to her.\" Peace of Himley Road, Dudley, denies murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. The trial continues.",

The blue Renault Clio is first seen driving erratically on the M5 before crashing into an oncoming vehicle while on the wrong side of Shurdington Road. The offender, 30, was under the influence of cocaine and pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, drug driving and drink driving.

Fire crews were called to Kirkton Avenue in the Knightswood area of the city after a Mercedes went up in flames at 11pm on Monday night. Residents reported hearing loud banging noises before looking out to see the luxury motor on fire. Police have now launched a probe into the deliberate attack. Worried neighbours told the Record they fear someone has a vendetta after claims the vehicle was set on fire at the same spot as another car just weeks ago. A resident, who did not wish to be named, told the Record: \"The same thing happened just a couple weeks ago, I heard that was a case of mistaken identity. \"It's a bit of a concern - it seems like someone has got a vendetta. Another neighbour said: \"I heard a big pop before I saw the fire - this is the second time a car has been set on fire in the street. \"I was just about to phone the fire brigade when they came flying down the road. \"It is quite a concern.\" A third resident said: \"I heard a loud bang and I looked out and all I saw was large flames coming from the car.\" The Scottish Fire and Rescue service confirmed they attended the street after being called at 11.15pm. A spokesperson described the vehicle as being \"well alight\" and the investigation had been passed to police. A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: \u201cWe received a report of a car on fire at Kirkton Avenue, Glasgow, around 11.15pm on Monday, 23 August. \u201cThere were no reports of any injuries and the fire is being treated as wilful. \"Enquiries are ongoing.\" (Image: Daily Record) The car blaze is the latest in a string of petrol bomb attacks across the city. Businessman Brendan Hegarty\u2019s \u00a32.9million house in Cleveden was targeted twice in just 24-hours in May with the property being left damaged. Nightclub owner Chris Lessani's vehicle was torched at his Knightswood home at 1am on Friday August 6. The blaze spread to his property while he and his wife slept. Former Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell\u2019s home in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, was also badly damaged in a petrol bomb attack in May. He was forced to flee the property with his family in the early hours of the morning after fire spread from a car to the house. Business tycoon James Mortimer, who owns Rogano and private members club 29, fell victim to a similar attack in May after two of his cars - a Range Rover and a silver Mercedes - were torched at his Bothwell home Rangers goalie Allan McGregor's home was also targeted last August after two thugs torched his cars and fled the scene in a waiting vehicle.

                        "doc": "It sometimes takes him a moment to remember, but Robert MacIntyre is miles ahead of where he thought he\u2019d be at this point in his career. The Scot goes into this week\u2019s BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth still with a chance of making Padraig Harrington\u2019s European Ryder Cup team. He\u2019s also likely to finish the season in the world\u2019s top 50. But getting caught up in all of that, and his performances at the Masters and The Open, needs perspective. Mostly recalling what his goals were when he was starting out as a professional just three years ago. \u2018It\u2019s been a snowball\u2019 \u201cWhen I turned pro, I had set out a plan that I hoped to be on the European Tour within four years,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst year on the Challenge Tour was to find my feet, second year was to push for a Top 15 card and then third year to get it. \u201cI did it all in one and it\u2019s been a snowball since then. \u201cIt\u2019s now really good for going forward. I have two guaranteed Majors for next year, almost three. \u201cI am playing at the top end of world golf. I\u2019m in absolutely the perfect position for where I thought I would be. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be in this position so quickly, but you have to fight against the people in front of you. Right now that is in front of the best. That\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m too hard on myself, 100%\u2019 Having all this within reach has caused MacIntyre to sometimes be impatient, quite naturally. But the ability to switch off and come home to Oban to be with his friends and family has never been more important. \u201cI had seven or eight weeks with just one off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the Scottish and The Open to events in America, back home for a second vaccine, back out to America. \u201cIt was a helluva lot of travel and there\u2019s only so much one body can take. I\u2019m too hard on myself, 100%. But I know that\u2019s when I have to take a step back. \u201cGo back to the Oban air and sunshine and just be a 25-year-old guy again. Instead of trying to be a 35-year-old with a mindset on the course.\u201d \u2018When they are there, I play my best\u2019 And having his supportive family and entourage with him this week should make all the difference, he feels. \u201cThat\u2019s been the toughest thing about the States,\u201d he explained. Usually I\u2019d have someone out with me but because of the restrictions that wasn\u2019t allowed. \u201cEveryone knows that family means a lot to me and they will be at Wentworth. That\u2019s where I play my best. Masters, Opens, whenever they are there, I play my best. \u201cThat\u2019s because when I go away from the course, I\u2019m back being a son rather than being the boss! \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than, for instance, seeing my sister\u2019s wee one smiling when I come off the course. It just makes you realise that playing golf for a few weeks is not the be-all-and-end-all.\u201d This week is a big test around the West Course with so much at stake, but he feels ready. \u2018It\u2019s about taking baby steps\u2019 \u201cThere are a couple of things I need to improve in terms of self discipline,\u201d he said. \u201cWentworth is a golf course that is not a walkover. You need to play good golf and that suits my game. \u201cI\u2019m not putting any pressure on myself this week. I know what I\u2019m capable of and what not. \u201cI just need to play well and if I do that, I\u2019ll be thereabouts come Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting into contention again and back into having a chance to win. It\u2019s not easy to do and the field is strong, but I don\u2019t put pressure on myself. \u201cIf I win, I\u2019m in The Ryder Cup. It\u2019s that simple. But I\u2019m not going in thinking that if I bogey the first hole that it\u2019s over because it won\u2019t be. \u201cThere\u2019s 72 holes to do it and it\u2019s about taking baby steps and picking things off one by one.\u201d",

One fan pointed out the fact that the timing of Styles coming over, Pine had discovered sunglasses in his lap which could point to the reason his facial expression changed and why he suddenly stopped his applause. The whole movie has been surrounded by drama, mostly surrounding Pugh, who recently starred in the Marvel film Black Widow. It\u2019s reported that she is friends with Jason Sudeikis, who is the ex-partner of Olivia Wilde, who is directing the upcoming film. Shia LaBeouf was also initially cast to portray the role taken up by Styles. Speaking to Variety, Wilde said \u201cHis process was not confuctive to the ethos that I demand in my productions\u201d.",

Having come back for the Fermanagh Championship Final and Ulster quarter-final against Enniskillen and Dromore respectively, McGovern missed the semi-final against Clann Eireann. But he is back again pushing and he hopes to play some part in Sunday's final against Kilcoo and he is \"buzzing for it\". \"It\u2019s kind of surreal to be honest. You dream of this when you are younger and you can't really believe it but we can't really wait for it and it would be lovely to go and make a bit of history,\" he said. Having turned 22 on January 10, it would be a nice late birthday present for McGovern as well. But he knows the challenge that lies ahead. In his fourth season with the Harps, McGovern has seen and been part of the evolution of this team and their impact in Ulster. \"There is definitely more belief. I feel we are all a lot more confident. The first few years we were going out [in Ulster] I don\u2019t think we believed as much as this year. \"We believe we are the best team in it and we can win it, the confidence is there for is. We are not just going there to take part we want to go and win.\" In 2019, Derrygonnelly came close to reaching the Ulster Final only to be pipped by Sunday's opponents, Kilcoo, who in turn went on to lift their first ever Ulster title. So McGovern and his teammates know the challenge that lies ahead: \"We played them before in 2019 and they are a serious team and we are just preparing the best we can. \"We are confident we can go and show them what we can do and hopefully come away with the win but it is going to be a serious hard game. \"We played that well that day too. They got a goal near the end that set them up to win it. But they are a very good team and it is going to take a big performance to beat them.\" In recent years, the Harps club has been struck with tragedy, with Gavin and his family losing their father Damian. Much has been said of the impact Damian had on the club's development and some of the players now playing senior football, none more so than his three sons, Gavin, Ronan and Rian. He made the bold prediction in 2012, after Rian and Ronan won an Under-10 competition, that they were future county champions in 2022. However, they went a year early and the three of the brothers were champions this year. Remembering the likes of his father and Peter Jones is a huge driver for the squad said McGovern: \"It is definitely driving people on and giving people an extra bit of motivation we would like to go and do it for them.\" McGovern recalls how his father had high hopes for his boys and the club as they were moving up through underage: \"He used always go on about whenever we were playing underage football about winning championships and I remember he used to always say he would love to see us make an impact in Ulster. So it motivates us and we want to do it for him.\" On Sunday, there is the chance of history for the club and for Fermanagh. McGovern is determined to do everything he can to help the Harps and alongside his brothers, Ronan and Rian it would be even more special. \"It would be brilliant. It would be a dream come true. I couldn\u2019t even put it into words,\" McGovern concluded."

We are not just going there to take part we want to go and win.\" In 2019, Derrygonnelly came close to reaching the Ulster Final only to be pipped by Sunday's opponents, Kilcoo, who in turn went on to lift their first ever Ulster title. So McGovern and his teammates know the challenge that lies ahead: \"We played them before in 2019 and they are a serious team and we are just preparing the best we can. \"We are confident we can go and show them what we can do and hopefully come away with the win but it is going to be a serious hard game. \"We played that well that day too. They got a goal near the end that set them up to win it. But they are a very good team and it is going to take a big performance to beat them.\" In recent years, the Harps club has been struck with tragedy, with Gavin and his family losing their father Damian. Much has been said of the impact Damian had on the club's development and some of the players now playing senior football, none more so than his three sons, Gavin, Ronan and Rian. He made the bold prediction in 2012, after Rian and Ronan won an Under-10 competition, that they were future county champions in 2022. However, they went a year early and the three of the brothers were champions this year. Remembering the likes of his father and Peter Jones is a huge driver for the squad said McGovern: \"It is definitely driving people on and giving people an extra bit of motivation we would like to go and do it for them.\" McGovern recalls how his father had high hopes for his boys and the club as they were moving up through underage: \"He used always go on about whenever we were playing underage football about winning championships and I remember he used to always say he would love to see us make an impact in Ulster. So it motivates us and we want to do it for him.\" On Sunday, there is the chance of history for the club and for Fermanagh. McGovern is determined to do everything he can to help the Harps and alongside his brothers, Ronan and Rian it would be even more special. \"It would be brilliant. It would be a dream come true. I couldn\u2019t even put it into words,\" McGovern concluded.",

So what of those who have come before? Here is a look at some of City's Irish contingent. Wes Hoolahan, an undisputed Norwich City legend. (Image: \u00a9Focus Images Limitedwww.focus-images.co.uk+447814 482222) Legends Three Irishman have genuine claims of being Norwich City legends. The most memorable for the modern generation of supporters is Wes Hoolahan. With over 300 appearances and a decade of service to the Canaries, few were better to watch than Wes when on full form. When he had the ball at his feet, Hoolahan was capable of producing a piece of brilliance that could decide a match. Johnny Gavin is another Irish member of City's 300 club and an undeniable club legend for his contribution in yellow and green. His statistics for the Canaries speak for themselves, in 338 games the attacker netted 123 goals. Gary Doherty was the man who proved Paul Lambert wrong and was a loyal servant for the Canaries between 2004-10. The central defender, who was also deployed as a striker on occasion, made 225 appearances for the club. Keith O'Neill made 13 appearances for the Republic of Ireland. (Image: Archant) Irish internationals Phil Kelly, a full-back who made over 100 appearances for Norwich City, played five international matches for the Republic of Ireland between 1950-51. The right-back, who signed for the Canaries in 1962, was a consistent partner to back four colleagues Joe Mullett, Bryan Thurlow and Barry Staton. Kelly even once filled in for Kevin Keelan in goal after the keeper was sent off against Northampton Town. Other Irish internationals to have represented Norwich City include John Devine, the unused substitute in the 1985 MIlk Cup triumph and Keith O'Neill, who graduated through the club's academy before failing to agree a new deal and signing for Middlesbrough. More recently, Robbie Brady has been an Irish regular who has played his club football at Carrow Road. The Dubliner completed a move to Norfolk in 2015 after a lengthy summer pursuit and stayed at the club until January 2017. Anthony Pilkington, Mike Milligan and Andy Townsend have all featured on the international stage for Ireland despite being born in England.

From Alan Lee's controversial loan spell to Stephen Elliott's important brace against Huddersfield during their League One title win, City have signed a range of players on temporary deals from the Emerald Isle. David Mooney, who joined City from Reading in 2009, scored twice in his first three starts at the club but failed to add to his tally after remaining the club for the rest of the season.

So what of those who have come before? Here is a look at some of City's Irish contingent. Wes Hoolahan, an undisputed Norwich City legend. (Image: \u00a9Focus Images Limitedwww.focus-images.co.uk+447814 482222) Legends Three Irishman have genuine claims of being Norwich City legends. The most memorable for the modern generation of supporters is Wes Hoolahan. With over 300 appearances and a decade of service to the Canaries, few were better to watch than Wes when on full form. When he had the ball at his feet, Hoolahan was capable of producing a piece of brilliance that could decide a match. Johnny Gavin is another Irish member of City's 300 club and an undeniable club legend for his contribution in yellow and green. His statistics for the Canaries speak for themselves, in 338 games the attacker netted 123 goals. Gary Doherty was the man who proved Paul Lambert wrong and was a loyal servant for the Canaries between 2004-10. The central defender, who was also deployed as a striker on occasion, made 225 appearances for the club. Keith O'Neill made 13 appearances for the Republic of Ireland. (Image: Archant) Irish internationals Phil Kelly, a full-back who made over 100 appearances for Norwich City, played five international matches for the Republic of Ireland between 1950-51. The right-back, who signed for the Canaries in 1962, was a consistent partner to back four colleagues Joe Mullett, Bryan Thurlow and Barry Staton. Kelly even once filled in for Kevin Keelan in goal after the keeper was sent off against Northampton Town. Other Irish internationals to have represented Norwich City include John Devine, the unused substitute in the 1985 MIlk Cup triumph and Keith O'Neill, who graduated through the club's academy before failing to agree a new deal and signing for Middlesbrough. More recently, Robbie Brady has been an Irish regular who has played his club football at Carrow Road. The Dubliner completed a move to Norfolk in 2015 after a lengthy summer pursuit and stayed at the club until January 2017. Anthony Pilkington, Mike Milligan and Andy Townsend have all featured on the international stage for Ireland despite being born in England.

From Alan Lee's controversial loan spell to Stephen Elliott's important brace against Huddersfield during their League One title win, City have signed a range of players on temporary deals from the Emerald Isle. David Mooney, who joined City from Reading in 2009, scored twice in his first three starts at the club but failed to add to his tally after remaining the club for the rest of the season.

Picture: Andrew Milligan/PA Wire Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the government to review RT\u2019s license to broadcast in the UK, and the long-awaited report from the Intelligence and Security Committee accused RT, formerly known as Russia Today, of putting out \u201cserious distortions\u201d along with fellow state-owned broadcaster Sputnik \u2013 which has its main UK newsroom in Edinburgh. The former First Minister launched the Alex Salmond Show in 2017. Mr Salmond resigned as an SNP member in August 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he was cleared of in March after a criminal trial. A spokesman for the Labour leader said: \u201cWe completely condemn [Mr Salmond\u2019s RT programme] and we advise the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to do the same. She should make a public statement condemning it.\u201d During an Urgent Question debate in the Commons on the ISC report, former Scottish Secretary David Mundell claimed Mr Salmond was an \u201capparatchik\u201d for Russia Today \u2013 a Russian term for a political appointee. \u201cWhat\u2019s just as concerning is the unwillingness of so many nationalists to call out this behaviour despite saying they have concerns about Russia,\u201d Mr Mundell said later. \u201cAfter the report was published we should have heard the First Minister speak out, so I now call on her\u2026 to condemn Alex Salmond\u2019s ongoing relationship with the Russian state in the strongest possible terms.\u201d And Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said Mr Salmond \u201cneeds to accept that he has been promoting a TV channel that has a damaging agenda for western democracy\u201d. An SNP spokesperson dismissed the criticism of Ms Sturgeon, saying she had made her views clear on Mr Salmond\u2019s involvement with RT \u201cliterally the day after\u201d his programme was announced. The First Minister said in 2017 that \u201cthe choice of channel would not have been my choice\u201d. \u201cThis is little more than a smokescreen to try and conceal the devastating criticisms by the ISC report of the Tory government\u2019s negligence in failing to even assess the level of Russian interference into the EU referendum,\u201d the SNP spokesman said. \u201cIf Labour and the Tories really want to move things forward perhaps they should be looking into unelected Labour and Tory Lords\u2019 business links with Russia, which was one of the most serious conclusions from this report.\u201d Mr Salmond was approached for comment. The Labour leader used yesterday\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions to distance himself from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s record on Russia, following criticism of his predecessor for not condemning Moscow\u2019s involvement in the Salisbury chemical attack swiftly enough. Mr Starmer has said \u201cthe Labour Party is under new management\u201d after he was criticised by Boris Johnson for not resigning from the Labour front bench over the matter. The Labour leader pressed for action against \u201cKremlin-backed disinformation\u201d and suggested Mr Johnson should \u201clook again\u201d at licensing for RT. The Prime Minister said Mr Starmer should have called out his predecessor \u201cwhen he took money for appearing on Russia Today\u201d, adding: \u201cThe Leader of the Opposition has more flip-flops than Bournemouth beach.\u201d"

Every window is smashed or blown out after being scorched by flames. What remains of the roof beams are now black. Locals reported the second blaze yesterday, August 5, which saw huge plumes of thick smoke fill the sky. Read more:Bagot Arms blaze sees huge plumes of black smoke rise into Erdington sky Seven fire crews, including 35 firefighters, were dispatched to the derelict Bagot Arms pub, at the junction of Eachelhurst Road and Chester Road, in Erdington. There were no known casualties, according to West Midlands Fire Service. But after the second arson attack at the Bagot Arms within weeks, question marks remain over what will become of the building which is clearly not fit for purpose. In June, an arson investigation was launched by police after firefighters contained ablaze within a garage at the same site. But locals told BirminghamLive that the second was far worse. When we arrived the morning after the second blaze, gas workers were cutting off gas to the building, something which could indicate the ferociousness of the blaze given this doesn't seem to have been done after the first fire. Residents stopped to take pictures. One lady, who couldn't chat, described the sorry situation as \"inevitable\". A man, who asked not to be named, looked emotional as he surveyed the ruins of a former iconic city establishment. He told BirminghamLive he lived around the corner and had a lot of memories at the pub - including with his wife who he lost to cancer. \"My wife died of cancer and we had a bit of a do here. So there are a lot of memories,\" he explained. \"Me and my wife used to come in here all the time. All my sons have drank in here, my daughters.\" He went on: \"The kids have got in and smashed all the windows. They have vandalised everything.\" He added that he saw smoke billowing out of the building after receiving a call from his son. \"There were fire engines and ambulances everywhere, they did a good job really. It's the whole of the building,\" he went on. \"The fire in June was at the back. This one was terrible compared to the one in June. They [doused] that pretty easy but this one they were on it for hours.\" He said it was a \"shame\" to see it in the condition it had been left in. \"People who I have spoken to said they enjoyed coming here at Christmas and getting together. And now it ends up like this. It will be knocked down won't it? There's nothing they can do with it now, it's too late.\" The Bagot Arms has a chequered history. While a well-known and once-popular establishment, cops swooped in the Erdington pub in March 2019 and raided a cannabis farm that has been growing inside. On social media, locals speculated about the fate of the iconic building. Shirley Kelly wrote: \"It will be missed, had some good memories in there. I was hoping it would have been re-opened in the future when it was first closed, but not to be, unfortunately.\" Nathan Messenger suggested: \"It [will] be knocked down now and [houses] will be built.\" Anette Histon added: \"Knock it down and build affordable homes for families.\" Lisa Mwale replied: \"Plenty of homeless that could do with a roof over their heads.

Every window is smashed or blown out after being scorched by flames. What remains of the roof beams are now black. Locals reported the second blaze yesterday, August 5, which saw huge plumes of thick smoke fill the sky. Read more:Bagot Arms blaze sees huge plumes of black smoke rise into Erdington sky Seven fire crews, including 35 firefighters, were dispatched to the derelict Bagot Arms pub, at the junction of Eachelhurst Road and Chester Road, in Erdington. There were no known casualties, according to West Midlands Fire Service. But after the second arson attack at the Bagot Arms within weeks, question marks remain over what will become of the building which is clearly not fit for purpose. In June, an arson investigation was launched by police after firefighters contained ablaze within a garage at the same site. But locals told BirminghamLive that the second was far worse. When we arrived the morning after the second blaze, gas workers were cutting off gas to the building, something which could indicate the ferociousness of the blaze given this doesn't seem to have been done after the first fire. Residents stopped to take pictures. One lady, who couldn't chat, described the sorry situation as \"inevitable\". A man, who asked not to be named, looked emotional as he surveyed the ruins of a former iconic city establishment. He told BirminghamLive he lived around the corner and had a lot of memories at the pub - including with his wife who he lost to cancer. \"My wife died of cancer and we had a bit of a do here. So there are a lot of memories,\" he explained. \"Me and my wife used to come in here all the time. All my sons have drank in here, my daughters.\" He went on: \"The kids have got in and smashed all the windows. They have vandalised everything.\" He added that he saw smoke billowing out of the building after receiving a call from his son. \"There were fire engines and ambulances everywhere, they did a good job really. It's the whole of the building,\" he went on. \"The fire in June was at the back. This one was terrible compared to the one in June. They [doused] that pretty easy but this one they were on it for hours.\" He said it was a \"shame\" to see it in the condition it had been left in. \"People who I have spoken to said they enjoyed coming here at Christmas and getting together. And now it ends up like this. It will be knocked down won't it? There's nothing they can do with it now, it's too late.\" The Bagot Arms has a chequered history. While a well-known and once-popular establishment, cops swooped in the Erdington pub in March 2019 and raided a cannabis farm that has been growing inside. On social media, locals speculated about the fate of the iconic building. Shirley Kelly wrote: \"It will be missed, had some good memories in there. I was hoping it would have been re-opened in the future when it was first closed, but not to be, unfortunately.\" Nathan Messenger suggested: \"It [will] be knocked down now and [houses] will be built.\" Anette Histon added: \"Knock it down and build affordable homes for families.\" Lisa Mwale replied: \"Plenty of homeless that could do with a roof over their heads.

And the visitors continued to score freely courtesy of Andrew Umeed (110) and Ali Awan (40) as K and D failed to take wickets at regular intervals as Moseley finished on 375-6.

Elsewhere, the club\u2019s 2nd XI won a thrilling contest against Standard (Coventry) CC by two wickets with Mohammed Fareed (48) top scoring whilst Anaesh Patel (5-22) claimed an impressive five-for with the ball.

Lastly, the club\u2019s 4th XI played out a draw with Studley after both teams finished on 194 runs.

(See the list of new shops at the end of this article.) \u201cThis level of new shops is well above average and better than adjoining towns such as Godalming,\u201d said Alex Bellion from local agents Owen Isherwood. He said shops with a service element which can\u2019t easily be obtained online, such as food, were doing best. Shops offering \u201cpure retail\u201d were fighting against online competition and were in less demand. Town traders were sounding stoical but there was an overall feeling of resilience. Footfall is creeping up but, at around 20 per cent down from pre-pandemic, it was seen as a fundamental issue. Surprisingly, few shopkeepers talked about the cost of living crisis or energy prices. But Lucy of Solar Sisters said energy costs are high and getting worse and added: \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely tough climate for small independent businesses. Rent is our biggest issue\u201d. More traders complained about parking charges which were seen not as a huge cost but more a deterrent to shoppers. One trader said: \u201cSome people are feeling the pinch now and looking at prices, but the high-end shops are doing well\u201d. Bellion said there is good demand for shops \u201cif landlords are sensible with rents\u201d and added that rents had gone down by as much as 50 per cent in the prime, \u201ccobbled\u201d area of the High Street and up to 25 per cent reduction in the adjacent roads. He said demand in the out-of-town centre shopping parades was also good with few shops staying empty for long. Continuing the trend of the last two quarters, there are six new ventures in the process of opening or applying for planning permission for their new shop signs. A Carl Scarpa shoe shop has put in a planning application for the former Prestons jewellery shop in the High Street. Just up the road, Danish bakers, Ole & Steen, are hoping to move to the Ted Baker clothes shop which is closing on July 3. And yet another new bakers, Hoxton Bakehouse, is only days away from opening in Market Street. Other shops are hoping their presence will give Market Street the bounce Gail\u2019s Bakery gave to Tunsgate. Kerrera, a craft beer and gin bar is looking to open in Jeffries Passage next to the haute-cuisine Indian restaurant, Ravis. A welcome addition to North Street, the engineered wood flooring and cladding specialists, Havwoods, will be opening in the next couple of weeks in the long-empty shop formerly occupied by the furniture shop, Wesley-Barrell. A new cocktails and cabaret bar, Fallen Angel, is due to open on June 25. Said to be the brainchild of Guildford entrepreneur and Guildford Fringe owner, Nick Whyscna, it promises \u201cDrag, Burlesque, Comedy and Theatre as well as the best cocktails in town and the staff at The Fallen Angel are all performers\u201d. Actress Jenny Seagrove is a patron and writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth is on the board. But whilst there were more positives than negatives, the difficult conditions for retail continued. Jack Wills clothes shop in the High Street is up for rent. Staff in the shop said they hadn\u2019t been told what was happening to the store which went into administration in 2019 and had been bought by Sports Direct. The new shops since Christmas 2021 include chains TAG Heuer watches, fast food Taco Bell, Itsu Asian fast food, London Medical Laboratory, Ivy Asia, Sleep 8 sleeping beds and mattresses, Thai street food Slim Chickens, opticians Ollie Quinn, Celly\u2019s Unisex Hair Salon. Yet to open include: bakers Hoxton Bakehouse, Carl Scarpa shoe shop, Danish bakers Ole & Steen and wood flooring and cladding specialistsHavwoods.

(See the list of new shops at the end of this article.) \u201cThis level of new shops is well above average and better than adjoining towns such as Godalming,\u201d said Alex Bellion from local agents Owen Isherwood. He said shops with a service element which can\u2019t easily be obtained online, such as food, were doing best. Shops offering \u201cpure retail\u201d were fighting against online competition and were in less demand. Town traders were sounding stoical but there was an overall feeling of resilience. Footfall is creeping up but, at around 20 per cent down from pre-pandemic, it was seen as a fundamental issue. Surprisingly, few shopkeepers talked about the cost of living crisis or energy prices. But Lucy of Solar Sisters said energy costs are high and getting worse and added: \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely tough climate for small independent businesses. Rent is our biggest issue\u201d. More traders complained about parking charges which were seen not as a huge cost but more a deterrent to shoppers. One trader said: \u201cSome people are feeling the pinch now and looking at prices, but the high-end shops are doing well\u201d. Bellion said there is good demand for shops \u201cif landlords are sensible with rents\u201d and added that rents had gone down by as much as 50 per cent in the prime, \u201ccobbled\u201d area of the High Street and up to 25 per cent reduction in the adjacent roads. He said demand in the out-of-town centre shopping parades was also good with few shops staying empty for long. Continuing the trend of the last two quarters, there are six new ventures in the process of opening or applying for planning permission for their new shop signs. A Carl Scarpa shoe shop has put in a planning application for the former Prestons jewellery shop in the High Street. Just up the road, Danish bakers, Ole & Steen, are hoping to move to the Ted Baker clothes shop which is closing on July 3. And yet another new bakers, Hoxton Bakehouse, is only days away from opening in Market Street. Other shops are hoping their presence will give Market Street the bounce Gail\u2019s Bakery gave to Tunsgate. Kerrera, a craft beer and gin bar is looking to open in Jeffries Passage next to the haute-cuisine Indian restaurant, Ravis. A welcome addition to North Street, the engineered wood flooring and cladding specialists, Havwoods, will be opening in the next couple of weeks in the long-empty shop formerly occupied by the furniture shop, Wesley-Barrell. A new cocktails and cabaret bar, Fallen Angel, is due to open on June 25. Said to be the brainchild of Guildford entrepreneur and Guildford Fringe owner, Nick Whyscna, it promises \u201cDrag, Burlesque, Comedy and Theatre as well as the best cocktails in town and the staff at The Fallen Angel are all performers\u201d. Actress Jenny Seagrove is a patron and writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth is on the board. But whilst there were more positives than negatives, the difficult conditions for retail continued.

Downhill Billies tackle the course. Photo: Keith Gluyas. The event, due to take place on Sunday, June 26, has seen a record number of entries, and will see a total of 38 soap boxes hurtling down the track at Hadway Common in the village. Racers have travelled from as far and wide as Plymouth and Hertfordshire as well as some favourite local entries such as the Orleton Primary school red bus, Wallace and Gromit, and the return of the Trotter family with their yellow Reliant Robin. The course is 550m long with a descent of 50m, with parts of the course steeper than others meaning participants can expect to reach speeds of up to 40mph. A competitor loses control and ends upside-down. Photo: Keith Gluyas. The event, which raises, up to \u00a315,000 annually, will this year support the Ludlow Ukrainian Refugee Support Group, The Hope Centre in Bromyard, and Ludlow\u2019s Men in Sheds. The Soap box Derby starts at 10am on 26th June, tickets are \u00a35 per adult on the gate, children under 16 are free of charge.

Racers have travelled from as far and wide as Plymouth and Hertfordshire as well as some favourite local entries such as the Orleton Primary school red bus, Wallace and Gromit, and the return of the Trotter family with their yellow Reliant Robin. The course is 550m long with a descent of 50m, with parts of the course steeper than others meaning participants can expect to reach speeds of up to 40mph. A competitor loses control and ends upside-down. Photo: Keith Gluyas. The event, which raises, up to \u00a315,000 annually, will this year support the Ludlow Ukrainian Refugee Support Group, The Hope Centre in Bromyard, and Ludlow\u2019s Men in Sheds.

            "doc": "A PLAN to trial the closure of a road in Henley town centre to support retailers is to be investigated further. Members of the council\u2019s town and committee agreed to consider shutting Market Place once a month despite criticism from some members and traders. The idea was branded \u201cbonkers\u201d and Deputy Mayor David Eggleton said it would \u201ckill\u201d the town. Sarah Miller, who chairs the committee, first proposed closing the road from the crossroads to the Greys Road car park entrance, saying it would mean more space for events, such as markets, as well as outdoor space for retailers and hospitality outlets. Another option would be to close the road in front of the town hall to create more space. Councillor Miller told last week\u2019s virtual meeting of the committee: \u201cI know lots of people are getting all flappy and thinking it\u2019s going to be a nightmare and the traffic\u2019s going to be awful. but I would just like to say if we don\u2019t try anything then nothing will move on and we will just be the same old Henley. \u201cThe high streets before the virus were dying and I think that, as a town, whether it\u2019s closing roads or whatever, we need to start thinking a little bit outside the box. \u201cWays that we can facilitate the retailers, the restaurants and the pubs that don\u2019t have gardens and make it a really exciting place to visit, to have a heart of the town which is buzzing and exciting. \u201cI would never want to hurt the retailers but I don\u2019t see how this would. The only issue I see would be the traffic but it\u2019s only once a month. \u201cThis could be absolutely amazing and I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t just try it. If it\u2019s not good, we will revert to normal Henley.\u201d Councillor Will Hamilton said retailers and businesses had told him it would \u201cstupid\u201d to close Market Place. \u201cAt the moment it would be bonkers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we have traffic going up White Hill on a Sunday morning backing up to the top of the hill we can\u2019t afford to close any roads.\u201d Market Place is currently closed on Remembrance Sunday and for the Christmas Festival, But Cllr Hamilton said: \u201cI really do not think we should be closing that road at any point, for any event, apart from the two we already do. We\u2019d just cause absolute carnage.\u201d Councillor Eggleton said: \u201cI\u2019m not in agreement with closing any roads because you only have to have an incident and then the whole of Henley becomes gridlocked. I believe the Market Place works as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be closed anymore. If you stop the traffic from coming in you will kill the town.\u201d Councillor Lorraine Hillier, who owns the Hot Gossip coffee shop in Reading Road, said the idea was met with \u201ca lot of opposition\u201d at a recent meeting of retailers. \u201cI think you\u2019re in danger of making Henley market place-centric again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of restaurants and pubs outside the market place that actually have no outside space. It\u2019s a natural gathering place anyway because of markets.\u201d Councillor Glen Lambert said that some years ago the bottom of Greys Road was closed between the junction with Reading Road and Duke Street and the Greys Road car park. He said: \u201cEveryone predicted it would be an absolute disaster in the mornings and the traffic would back way up but when it actually happened the traffic naturally redistributed itself. \u201cI live on Greys Road and I found it much better for getting in and out of Henley than it was before. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know exactly what\u2019s going to happen until you try it and I think there\u2019s no harm in trying these things every now and again. It would be irresponsible of us as a council if we weren\u2019t open to new ideas. When we talk about closing a road to pedestrianise a wider area, what we\u2019re doing is prioritising people who are in the town, enjoying it and spending money over people driving through. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay to have that trade off every now and again.\u201d Councillor Michelle Thomas said that in the months since the lockdown people had enjoyed the lower traffic levels. \u201cIt will be so polluted in Henley when it does go back to normal and I would welcome having less traffic in town,\u201d she said. She encouraged residents to leave their cars at home if they lived within a mile of the town centre, adding: \u201cYou have got people doing very, very short journeys and it is not necessary. Please use your legs and your feet.\u201d Councillor Ian Reissmann said: \u201cIf you make an effort to experiment and it works, that\u2019s great. If it doesn\u2019t work we have one day where there\u2019s perhaps some minor disruption and then perhaps we can think again. \u201cBut considering a creative, innovative idea as part of a whole range of plans makes obvious sense to me and I can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not at least investigating the possibility of a trial.\u201d The committee voted by six votes to two in favour of investigating the idea further."

We\u2019d just cause absolute carnage.\u201d Councillor Eggleton said: \u201cI\u2019m not in agreement with closing any roads because you only have to have an incident and then the whole of Henley becomes gridlocked. I believe the Market Place works as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be closed anymore. If you stop the traffic from coming in you will kill the town.\u201d Councillor Lorraine Hillier, who owns the Hot Gossip coffee shop in Reading Road, said the idea was met with \u201ca lot of opposition\u201d at a recent meeting of retailers. \u201cI think you\u2019re in danger of making Henley market place-centric again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of restaurants and pubs outside the market place that actually have no outside space. It\u2019s a natural gathering place anyway because of markets.\u201d Councillor Glen Lambert said that some years ago the bottom of Greys Road was closed between the junction with Reading Road and Duke Street and the Greys Road car park. He said: \u201cEveryone predicted it would be an absolute disaster in the mornings and the traffic would back way up but when it actually happened the traffic naturally redistributed itself. \u201cI live on Greys Road and I found it much better for getting in and out of Henley than it was before. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know exactly what\u2019s going to happen until you try it and I think there\u2019s no harm in trying these things every now and again. It would be irresponsible of us as a council if we weren\u2019t open to new ideas. When we talk about closing a road to pedestrianise a wider area, what we\u2019re doing is prioritising people who are in the town, enjoying it and spending money over people driving through. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay to have that trade off every now and again.\u201d Councillor Michelle Thomas said that in the months since the lockdown people had enjoyed the lower traffic levels. \u201cIt will be so polluted in Henley when it does go back to normal and I would welcome having less traffic in town,\u201d she said. She encouraged residents to leave their cars at home if they lived within a mile of the town centre, adding: \u201cYou have got people doing very, very short journeys and it is not necessary.

If it doesn\u2019t work we have one day where there\u2019s perhaps some minor disruption and then perhaps we can think again. \u201cBut considering a creative, innovative idea as part of a whole range of plans makes obvious sense to me and I can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not at least investigating the possibility of a trial.\u201d The committee voted by six votes to two in favour of investigating the idea further.",

Members of the council\u2019s town and committee agreed to consider shutting Market Place once a month despite criticism from some members and traders. The idea was branded \u201cbonkers\u201d and Deputy Mayor David Eggleton said it would \u201ckill\u201d the town. Sarah Miller, who chairs the committee, first proposed closing the road from the crossroads to the Greys Road car park entrance, saying it would mean more space for events, such as markets, as well as outdoor space for retailers and hospitality outlets. Another option would be to close the road in front of the town hall to create more space. Councillor Miller told last week\u2019s virtual meeting of the committee: \u201cI know lots of people are getting all flappy and thinking it\u2019s going to be a nightmare and the traffic\u2019s going to be awful. but I would just like to say if we don\u2019t try anything then nothing will move on and we will just be the same old Henley. \u201cThe high streets before the virus were dying and I think that, as a town, whether it\u2019s closing roads or whatever, we need to start thinking a little bit outside the box. \u201cWays that we can facilitate the retailers, the restaurants and the pubs that don\u2019t have gardens and make it a really exciting place to visit, to have a heart of the town which is buzzing and exciting. \u201cI would never want to hurt the retailers but I don\u2019t see how this would. The only issue I see would be the traffic but it\u2019s only once a month. \u201cThis could be absolutely amazing and I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t just try it. If it\u2019s not good, we will revert to normal Henley.\u201d Councillor Will Hamilton said retailers and businesses had told him it would \u201cstupid\u201d to close Market Place. \u201cAt the moment it would be bonkers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we have traffic going up White Hill on a Sunday morning backing up to the top of the hill we can\u2019t afford to close any roads.\u201d Market Place is currently closed on Remembrance Sunday and for the Christmas Festival, But Cllr Hamilton said: \u201cI really do not think we should be closing that road at any point, for any event, apart from the two we already do. We\u2019d just cause absolute carnage.\u201d Councillor Eggleton said: \u201cI\u2019m not in agreement with closing any roads because you only have to have an incident and then the whole of Henley becomes gridlocked. I believe the Market Place works as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be closed anymore. If you stop the traffic from coming in you will kill the town.\u201d Councillor Lorraine Hillier, who owns the Hot Gossip coffee shop in Reading Road, said the idea was met with \u201ca lot of opposition\u201d at a recent meeting of retailers. \u201cI think you\u2019re in danger of making Henley market place-centric again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of restaurants and pubs outside the market place that actually have no outside space. It\u2019s a natural gathering place anyway because of markets.\u201d Councillor Glen Lambert said that some years ago the bottom of Greys Road was closed between the junction with Reading Road and Duke Street and the Greys Road car park. He said: \u201cEveryone predicted it would be an absolute disaster in the mornings and the traffic would back way up but when it actually happened the traffic naturally redistributed itself. \u201cI live on Greys Road and I found it much better for getting in and out of Henley than it was before. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know exactly what\u2019s going to happen until you try it and I think there\u2019s no harm in trying these things every now and again. It would be irresponsible of us as a council if we weren\u2019t open to new ideas. When we talk about closing a road to pedestrianise a wider area, what we\u2019re doing is prioritising people who are in the town, enjoying it and spending money over people driving through. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay to have that trade off every now and again.\u201d Councillor Michelle Thomas said that in the months since the lockdown people had enjoyed the lower traffic levels. \u201cIt will be so polluted in Henley when it does go back to normal and I would welcome having less traffic in town,\u201d she said.

Another option would be to close the road in front of the town hall to create more space. Councillor Miller told last week\u2019s virtual meeting of the committee: \u201cI know lots of people are getting all flappy and thinking it\u2019s going to be a nightmare and the traffic\u2019s going to be awful. but I would just like to say if we don\u2019t try anything then nothing will move on and we will just be the same old Henley. \u201cThe high streets before the virus were dying and I think that, as a town, whether it\u2019s closing roads or whatever, we need to start thinking a little bit outside the box. \u201cWays that we can facilitate the retailers, the restaurants and the pubs that don\u2019t have gardens and make it a really exciting place to visit, to have a heart of the town which is buzzing and exciting. \u201cI would never want to hurt the retailers but I don\u2019t see how this would. The only issue I see would be the traffic but it\u2019s only once a month. \u201cThis could be absolutely amazing and I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t just try it. If it\u2019s not good, we will revert to normal Henley.\u201d Councillor Will Hamilton said retailers and businesses had told him it would \u201cstupid\u201d to close Market Place. \u201cAt the moment it would be bonkers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we have traffic going up White Hill on a Sunday morning backing up to the top of the hill we can\u2019t afford to close any roads.\u201d Market Place is currently closed on Remembrance Sunday and for the Christmas Festival, But Cllr Hamilton said: \u201cI really do not think we should be closing that road at any point, for any event, apart from the two we already do. We\u2019d just cause absolute carnage.\u201d Councillor Eggleton said: \u201cI\u2019m not in agreement with closing any roads because you only have to have an incident and then the whole of Henley becomes gridlocked. I believe the Market Place works as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be closed anymore. If you stop the traffic from coming in you will kill the town.\u201d Councillor Lorraine Hillier, who owns the Hot Gossip coffee shop in Reading Road, said the idea was met with \u201ca lot of opposition\u201d at a recent meeting of retailers. \u201cI think you\u2019re in danger of making Henley market place-centric again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of restaurants and pubs outside the market place that actually have no outside space. It\u2019s a natural gathering place anyway because of markets.\u201d Councillor Glen Lambert said that some years ago the bottom of Greys Road was closed between the junction with Reading Road and Duke Street and the Greys Road car park. He said: \u201cEveryone predicted it would be an absolute disaster in the mornings and the traffic would back way up but when it actually happened the traffic naturally redistributed itself. \u201cI live on Greys Road and I found it much better for getting in and out of Henley than it was before. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know exactly what\u2019s going to happen until you try it and I think there\u2019s no harm in trying these things every now and again. It would be irresponsible of us as a council if we weren\u2019t open to new ideas. When we talk about closing a road to pedestrianise a wider area, what we\u2019re doing is prioritising people who are in the town, enjoying it and spending money over people driving through. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay to have that trade off every now and again.\u201d Councillor Michelle Thomas said that in the months since the lockdown people had enjoyed the lower traffic levels. \u201cIt will be so polluted in Henley when it does go back to normal and I would welcome having less traffic in town,\u201d she said. She encouraged residents to leave their cars at home if they lived within a mile of the town centre, adding: \u201cYou have got people doing very, very short journeys and it is not necessary. Please use your legs and your feet.\u201d Councillor Ian Reissmann said: \u201cIf you make an effort to experiment and it works, that\u2019s great. If it doesn\u2019t work we have one day where there\u2019s perhaps some minor disruption and then perhaps we can think again. \u201cBut considering a creative, innovative idea as part of a whole range of plans makes obvious sense to me and I can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not at least investigating the possibility of a trial.\u201d The committee voted by six votes to two in favour of investigating the idea further.",

We\u2019d just cause absolute carnage.\u201d Councillor Eggleton said: \u201cI\u2019m not in agreement with closing any roads because you only have to have an incident and then the whole of Henley becomes gridlocked. I believe the Market Place works as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be closed anymore. If you stop the traffic from coming in you will kill the town.\u201d Councillor Lorraine Hillier, who owns the Hot Gossip coffee shop in Reading Road, said the idea was met with \u201ca lot of opposition\u201d at a recent meeting of retailers. \u201cI think you\u2019re in danger of making Henley market place-centric again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of restaurants and pubs outside the market place that actually have no outside space. It\u2019s a natural gathering place anyway because of markets.\u201d Councillor Glen Lambert said that some years ago the bottom of Greys Road was closed between the junction with Reading Road and Duke Street and the Greys Road car park. He said: \u201cEveryone predicted it would be an absolute disaster in the mornings and the traffic would back way up but when it actually happened the traffic naturally redistributed itself. \u201cI live on Greys Road and I found it much better for getting in and out of Henley than it was before. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually know exactly what\u2019s going to happen until you try it and I think there\u2019s no harm in trying these things every now and again. It would be irresponsible of us as a council if we weren\u2019t open to new ideas. When we talk about closing a road to pedestrianise a wider area, what we\u2019re doing is prioritising people who are in the town, enjoying it and spending money over people driving through. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay to have that trade off every now and again.\u201d Councillor Michelle Thomas said that in the months since the lockdown people had enjoyed the lower traffic levels. \u201cIt will be so polluted in Henley when it does go back to normal and I would welcome having less traffic in town,\u201d she said. She encouraged residents to leave their cars at home if they lived within a mile of the town centre, adding: \u201cYou have got people doing very, very short journeys and it is not necessary. Please use your legs and your feet.\u201d Councillor Ian Reissmann said: \u201cIf you make an effort to experiment and it works, that\u2019s great. If it doesn\u2019t work we have one day where there\u2019s perhaps some minor disruption and then perhaps we can think again. \u201cBut considering a creative, innovative idea as part of a whole range of plans makes obvious sense to me and I can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not at least investigating the possibility of a trial.\u201d The committee voted by six votes to two in favour of investigating the idea further.",

The Prime Minister\u2019s former chief aide reignited his war of words with Number 10 by revealing a conversation he claims to have had with the Prime Minister, in his latest attack on Mr Johnson and the Government. Vote Leave mastermind Mr Cummings used a blog post to claim that he knew that Mr Johnson was \u201cunfit to be PM\u201d, adding: \u201cWe also knew that he knew too, since he\u2019d told us.\u201d In a Substack blog, which subscribers are required to pay to access, Mr Cummings said the admission was made the day after the EU referendum and shortly after David Cameron quit as prime minister. Mr Cummings wrote: \u201cOn 24 June 2016 in Vote Leave HQ, just after Cameron had resigned, Boris pulled me into the odd little room where the \u2018campaign within the campaign\u2019 was run.

Advertisement Advertisement Hundreds of these calls were from Milton Keynes. But sometimes people may have been literally killing the tiny creatures with their kindness, A blackbird fledgling Today an RSPCA spokesman has given guidelines about when to intervene and when to leave a baby bird alone. \"Birds take far better care of their babies than humans can, and should only be taken into care as a last resort,\" he said. Around one third of all the calls (3,330) last year related to orphaned birds and another 3,252 were about sick and injured birds. The majority (4,611) were about fledglings (older baby birds that are starting to fly), which the RSPCA advises can generally be left to be cared for by their parents. Advertisement Advertisement The charity also received 1,413 calls about nestlings - the very young baby birds - who will not survive out of the nest. Nestlings are highly vulnerable and more likely to need help. Nestlings have no feathers The general advice is to avoid handling any wildlife unless absolutely necessary, always wear sturdy gloves and do not give baby birds or animals food or water. RSPCA\u2019s Scientific Officer Evie Button said: \u201cOur wildlife centres are now on high alert as the baby bird season kicks off. As well as handling thousands of calls - around 9,000 - last year, more than 5,400 orphaned, injured or sick young birds were brought into our four specialist centres. That\u2019s a lot of round-the-clock hand-feeding, monitoring and rehabilitation of all types of young birds, from cygnets, sparrows and swallows to guillemots, goshawks and gulls! She added: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that people want to do the best for our wildlife, but sometimes it\u2019s difficult to know when to intervene and when to hold back. It is really important to ensure it is only those that really need help that are brought in, and in most cases, the best thing you can do for them is to help them stay in the wild using methods like re-nesting. Advertisement Advertisement \"If in doubt, our new, downloadable guides - one for fledglings and one for nestlings - are full of advice and can help to identify whether the young bird is a fledgling - which unless sick or injured, is likely to survive outside the nest without human intervention - or a younger, more vulnerable nestling, which will probably need extra help.\u201d You can access the guides here. They help people differentiate between nestlings and fledglings. Nestlings are baby birds that have no feathers, or only a few. Nestlings won't survive long outside the protection of the nest and where possible nestlings should be re-nested and left in the wild, as birds take far better care of their babies than humans can, say RSPCA experts. Fledglings have all or most of their feathers and leave the nest just before they can fly, so it's normal to see them on the ground. Keep pets away, leave the fledgling alone and monitor, as the parents are usually nearby and feeding the bird. Advertisement Advertisement Even if you have already confined a healthy fledgling you may still be able to return them to their parents. If they're in immediate danger, place it in a sheltered spot a short distance away. In 2020, the RSPCA\u2019s wildlife centres cared for nearly 3,000 (2788) \u2018orphaned\u2019 birds, picked up by well-meaning people. But many of these birds were not actually orphans and may have been better off left in the wild, they say. \"Unlike fledglings, if a nestling is spotted outside their nest, they need assistance. Actions may include creating a manmade nest, taking the nestling to a vet or local rescue centre, or calling the RSPCA,\" said the spokesman, The charity also has specific information on their website for some species which may need different types of help, such as gull chicks, bird of prey chicks and ducklings, goslings and cygnets.

Cllr Kelham Cooke, will make his leap of faith in aid of Harry\u2019s Pals, a charity set up in 2020 to support parents of severely ill or disabled children who unexpectedly find out that their child has a life-limiting or life-threatening condition. Harry\u2019s Pals also pays for respite breaks for families coming to terms with the news, giving them much-needed time to recharge and recuperate, as well as offering bespoke counselling programmes for individuals or couples.

The hospital apologised to their loved ones and promised to make the findings of an investigation into their deaths public. In the report, published on Friday, the QEH says: \"The trust extends its condolences to those who lost loved ones and those who contracted Covid while in our care during the pandemic. Covid rules will remain in place beyond July 19 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. (Image: QEH) \"We recognise that it has been a very difficult time for relatives and friends of those who died, many of whom were sadly denied the opportunity to visit their loved ones due to the tightened visiting restrictions in place to maximise safety, and some never got to say their final goodbyes when those closest to them were approaching their end of life.\" The report says the outdated hospital made it difficult to prevent the spread of the virus. James-Wild-MP-urges-ministers-to-consider-new-hospital-in-Ki (1) \"Ideally, we wanted to keep any patient with confirmed or suspected Covid physically separate from other patients to minimise the chance of spread,\" it says. \"Unfortunately, QEH has a very limited number of side rooms and therefore regrettably some patients experienced numerous moves to try to minimise this exposure.\" The report adds: \"Currently, only 10pc of our patients are able to be cared for in side rooms and restraints with the hospital\u2019s physical environment posed a very significant challenge to the delivery of optimum care.\" The QEH was built with an expected working life of 30 years but is still in use after more than four decades, with props holdings its roof up.

(Image: QEH) It was not included on the list of new builds announced by the government last year and now hopes it will be one of eight further hospitals given the go-ahead in a new round of funding next spring. The report says many patients were subjected to multiple moves. The hospital appointed family liaison officers to keep families informed of their loved ones' condition and set up virtual visiting. But the report adds: \"While the trust took measures in March 2021 in real-time to respond to patient and family feedback about poor communication through the introduction of a new team of family liaison officers, for many we recognise this service came too late.\" The report describes how staff comforted patients whose relatives could not be allowed in to see them as the hospital battled to keep the virus at bay. It says many felt \"they had not only taken on the role of a clinician, but rather a mum, a dad, a brother, or a sister when family members were not able to be physically present in the hospital\".

School office manager, Vikki Till, said: \u201cWe are all so upset. Whoever did this set fire to everything \u2013 even the children\u2019s wellies and waterproof overalls were thrown on the fire. \"It\u2019s so upsetting for staff and pupils. We held an assembly on Friday morning to explain to the children what has happened.\u201d Pupils and staff at Wheldon Infant School & Nursery were devastated after their school was broken into and their outdoor forest classroom was burnt down. The Forest School is an outdoor, timetabled resource that the whole school uses for outdoor education. Vikki said: \u201cThere was a hut with a roof and a bench and table, so, regardless of the weather, children were able to learn outdoors. They took part in things like bug hunts and story time. \"It was always the highlight of their week. They all loved it and now it\u2019s been totally destroyed. \"It had taken around five years to get it set up and at a cost of around \u00a310,000 with all the landscaping, furniture and resources. The area was completely destroyed. \"The children are so upset and all the staff are all devastated. \"The sad thing is, whoever did this hasn\u2019t just damaged the hut and the furniture, they\u2019ve also thrown the children\u2019s wellies and waterproof overalls into the fire. \"It\u2019s not as though it was just someone who was walking past and broken in. It\u2019s a dead-end street \u2013 they've come in with some level of intent. \"They know it\u2019s a school, they know what they were taking away from the children.\u201d Chair of Governors John Hanson.

He now plans a series of cooking demonstrations that delve into India's street food scene this summer, with the first one selling out in only two days. Mr Mitchell, 48, became \"infatuated\" with traditional Indian cuisine following a trip to the southern Indian state of Kerala in 2003, where he learnt the art of 'desi' cooking, which means 'home-style'. Since then he has immersed himself in this style of cooking and went on to launch Chaat Man as a mobile street food business in 2016, visiting markets and festivals all over the UK before turning his focus locally. Mr Mitchell, from Long Stratton, said: \"After two years I decided to concentrate on the local area and began trading at local farmers' markets. \"As well as street food I started selling more fresh and frozen curries as well and after the pandemic the street food business took a back seat. \"People were craving restaurant-quality curries but couldn't go to restaurants so Chaat Man Indian Deli was born.\" The deli has a revolving menu of over 150 regional and speciality curries to choose from, with over 30 available each week. \"I'm a one man show.

He now plans a series of cooking demonstrations that delve into India's street food scene this summer, with the first one selling out in only two days. Mr Mitchell, 48, became \"infatuated\" with traditional Indian cuisine following a trip to the southern Indian state of Kerala in 2003, where he learnt the art of 'desi' cooking, which means 'home-style'. Since then he has immersed himself in this style of cooking and went on to launch Chaat Man as a mobile street food business in 2016, visiting markets and festivals all over the UK before turning his focus locally. Mr Mitchell, from Long Stratton, said: \"After two years I decided to concentrate on the local area and began trading at local farmers' markets. \"As well as street food I started selling more fresh and frozen curries as well and after the pandemic the street food business took a back seat. \"People were craving restaurant-quality curries but couldn't go to restaurants so Chaat Man Indian Deli was born.\" The deli has a revolving menu of over 150 regional and speciality curries to choose from, with over 30 available each week. \"I'm a one man show. I work six days a week\" said Mr Mitchell, adding: \"It's full on but for me it's not a job. \"I'm just doing it because it is what I love and the income is a nice side effect.\" Chaat Man Indian Deli is open Fridays 12pm - 6pm and Saturdays 10am - 4pm and orders can be made online at chaatman.co.uk or in-store. You can also find Mr Mitchell at local farmer's markets throughout the year. His cooking demonstration in May has already sold out but a further one is planned on Saturday, June 11. The secret behind a great curry sauce \"Time, time and more time,\" said Mr Mitchell. \"Long and slow cooking is key. Real 'desi' cooking takes hours which helps the flavours develop. \"Using freshly ground spices for the masala is really important and not using pre-ground spices that have been sat in plastic pots for months. \"Also making use of the best ingredients you can get is key. \"Add your freshly ground masala to the cooked-down onions and garlic. \"Next you want to add the base of your sauce which can be made in a number of different ways depending on the curry. \"You might use stock, coconut milk, tomatoes, ground coconut, blended onions, or a mixture of these. \"Once you have added the base of the sauce you want to continue cooking. \"You will know when the spices are cooked through when the fat rises to the top of the sauce. \"Then you will know that everything is cooked perfectly.\"",

They were alongside actress Katherine Kelly and comedian-actor Ben Miller who beat the others and claimed victory. And this week's cast list does not disappoint with big names of the comedy and the sports world coming together to bake in aid of Stand Up To Cancer. Singer Ellie Goulding and comedian Mawaan Rizwan will both be hoping to win the baking show and take home the converted apron. Plus, disability advocate Sophie Morgan and actress Tracy-Ann Oberman tackle a marble cake and a jam-roly-poly. The series will be split across five episodes, each one seeing four new celebrities try their hand at baking in the famous white tent. Each celebrity will compete in three rounds, much like in the Great British Bake Off. They\u2019ll try their best at the Signature, the Technical and the Showstopper tasks and we can\u2019t wait to see the results. How to watch The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer You can watch the baking completion on Channel 4 and All 4 at 8pm every Tuesday evening."

            "doc": "now Tears fell as mum-of-two Oryslava, who lives in Goosnargh, near Preston, was reunited with her elderly Ukrainian mother Olga Kogut near the Polish border. At first Olga, a 70 year old grandmother, had been adamant she would not leave Ukraine, despite the war and despite living alone in a flat in Lviv. But she made the decision to leave her homeland when Lviv came under intense attack from Russian forces in late March and she witnessed first hand the danger she was in. Oryslava and Ostap Anyonyuk collecting emergency supplies for Ukraine - they still need some termporary storage space in Goosnargh or Longridge for the aid donations Photo: Neil Cross Oryslava said she had pleaded with her mum to leave weeks earlier. She said: \u201cI was planning to get my mum over but she didn\u2019t want to leave, people in Ukraine don\u2019t want to leave their country. She was like I\u2019ll stick it out where we are.\u201d But at the end of March, as the Russians extended their deadly attacks, things changed suddenly for the elderly widow. Oryslava said: \"There were two attacks on a fuel storage (facility) and a factory where they manufactured tanks. She had actually seen the rockets coming, she had actually seen them in the sky, and two minutes after I got a phone call \u2013 please come over and pick me up.\u201d Oryslava Antonyuk, with her mum Olga, who has been rescued from Ukraine Oryslava 45, travelled to the Polish border. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t go to Ukraine. I stayed in Poland and one of our friends took her to the border. She crossed the border by foot. She only got some essential clothes and medicine she depends on. I met her on March 27 on the other side. She was shaking, very emotional, crying. She didn\u2019t want to leave, that\u2019s for sure. She said I can\u2019t keep on like that any more. She\u2019s 70, she\u2019s had two strokes. She had been there on her own. I\u2019m the only child in the family.\u201d From the border mother and daughter travelled to Warsaw, stayed overnight and got a flight to Amsterdam where Olga\u2019s grandson Markiyan, 25, lives. Because of the visa situation in the UK Olga couldn\u2019t come to England straight away. Oryslava said: \u201cWe filled in the application for the visa, the family scheme. I stayed a day or two to help her settle a bit. My son was working so he couldn\u2019t stay with her. At least she was safe in his flat.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite lucky I would say because the visa arrived seven days later, but it\u2019s still seven days. My mum was lucky because we had somewhere to stay. If not where would she have stayed \u2013 one of the refugee camps? Then finally I went there and picked her up and got her here. Once she arrived here she said I\u2019m safe now. I\u2019m happy now. It\u2019s a new place \u2026 I\u2019m happy because I don't hear the sirens every night.\u201d The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans Oryslava and her husband Ostap, 53, run a food company and owned and managed Eastern European shops in Lancashire and Manchester for many years. They now have a convenience store in Widnes. Oryslava said: \u201cAt the moment we are refusing to sell Russian foods.\u201d More relaxed because she does \u201dnot have to worry\u201d about her mother, for Oryslava and Ostap the grief and worry about the war in Ukraine remains. The couple are both British and Ukrainian and Oryslava said: \u201cOf course I do wake up at night because of what is happening at home. You can\u2019t have a normal sleep now since it all started.\u201d Concerns remain too for her husband\u2019s family whose parents and relatives remain in Ukraine. The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans The family, including daughter Yaryna, 21, have been working tirelessly to gather and send aid supplies to Ukraine, supporting an appeal set up by the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Manchester of which they are members. The couple\u2019s two children attended Stonyhurst College, near Longridge, and families of pupils there there have also responded generously to the appeal. But medical supplies, baby food and cash donations are still urgently needed. The cash donations are being used to buy food in Poland at wholesale prices for transport across the border. (For details of how to donate see below.) The family have been overwhelmed by the generosity of local people and those from further afield. Such generosity means extra storage space is now needed in Goosnargh or Longridge to store donations ready for collection. While juggling family, work and her aid work for Ukraine Oryslava says she is now looking forward to \u201ca nice, quiet happy family Easter\u201d which will be celebrated at the Ukrainian church in Manchester not this weekend, but next. For her mum Lancashire is in part a home from home as Oryslava explained: \u201cWe are in a very rural place with lots of fields and nice views from the house. She was born in a village as well with no street lights \u2013 pretty much the same environment.\u201d The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans There is no doubt says Oryslava that as soon as it is safe to do so her mother will want to return to Ukraine. But for the moment Lancashire is a welcome home from home. Oryslava said: \"This has changed her life.

At first Olga, a 70 year old grandmother, had been adamant she would not leave Ukraine, despite the war and despite living alone in a flat in Lviv.

She was like I\u2019ll stick it out where we are.\u201d But at the end of March, as the Russians extended their deadly attacks, things changed suddenly for the elderly widow.

She only got some essential clothes and medicine she depends on. I met her on March 27 on the other side. She was shaking, very emotional, crying. She didn\u2019t want to leave, that\u2019s for sure. She said I can\u2019t keep on like that any more. She\u2019s 70, she\u2019s had two strokes. She had been there on her own.

She was like I\u2019ll stick it out where we are.\u201d But at the end of March, as the Russians extended their deadly attacks, things changed suddenly for the elderly widow.

Because of the visa situation in the UK Olga couldn\u2019t come to England straight away. Oryslava said: \u201cWe filled in the application for the visa, the family scheme.

At first Olga, a 70 year old grandmother, had been adamant she would not leave Ukraine, despite the war and despite living alone in a flat in Lviv. But she made the decision to leave her homeland when Lviv came under intense attack from Russian forces in late March and she witnessed first hand the danger she was in. Oryslava and Ostap Anyonyuk collecting emergency supplies for Ukraine - they still need some termporary storage space in Goosnargh or Longridge for the aid donations Photo: Neil Cross Oryslava said she had pleaded with her mum to leave weeks earlier. She said: \u201cI was planning to get my mum over but she didn\u2019t want to leave, people in Ukraine don\u2019t want to leave their country. She was like I\u2019ll stick it out where we are.\u201d But at the end of March, as the Russians extended their deadly attacks, things changed suddenly for the elderly widow. Oryslava said: \"There were two attacks on a fuel storage (facility) and a factory where they manufactured tanks. She had actually seen the rockets coming, she had actually seen them in the sky, and two minutes after I got a phone call \u2013 please come over and pick me up.\u201d Oryslava Antonyuk, with her mum Olga, who has been rescued from Ukraine Oryslava 45, travelled to the Polish border. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t go to Ukraine. I stayed in Poland and one of our friends took her to the border. She crossed the border by foot. She only got some essential clothes and medicine she depends on. I met her on March 27 on the other side. She was shaking, very emotional, crying. She didn\u2019t want to leave, that\u2019s for sure. She said I can\u2019t keep on like that any more. She\u2019s 70, she\u2019s had two strokes. She had been there on her own. I\u2019m the only child in the family.\u201d From the border mother and daughter travelled to Warsaw, stayed overnight and got a flight to Amsterdam where Olga\u2019s grandson Markiyan, 25, lives. Because of the visa situation in the UK Olga couldn\u2019t come to England straight away. Oryslava said: \u201cWe filled in the application for the visa, the family scheme. I stayed a day or two to help her settle a bit. My son was working so he couldn\u2019t stay with her. At least she was safe in his flat.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite lucky I would say because the visa arrived seven days later, but it\u2019s still seven days. My mum was lucky because we had somewhere to stay. If not where would she have stayed \u2013 one of the refugee camps? Then finally I went there and picked her up and got her here. Once she arrived here she said I\u2019m safe now. I\u2019m happy now.

But medical supplies, baby food and cash donations are still urgently needed. The cash donations are being used to buy food in Poland at wholesale prices for transport across the border. (For details of how to donate see below.) The family have been overwhelmed by the generosity of local people and those from further afield. Such generosity means extra storage space is now needed in Goosnargh or Longridge to store donations ready for collection.

She was born in a village as well with no street lights \u2013 pretty much the same environment.\u201d The Antonyuks, with the help of volunteers, have been packing up donations for Ukraine, mainly medical supplies and baby supplies for orphans There is no doubt says Oryslava that as soon as it is safe to do so her mother will want to return to Ukraine. But for the moment Lancashire is a welcome home from home. Oryslava said: \"This has changed her life. She had no choice \u2013 for her own health and for a no stress life. \u201c How to help To donate medical supplies or baby foods or offer storage space for donations contact Oryslava on: 07912 748635.

Let us know in our survey below: \"When you take your child to school, always keep your distance from other parents, wear a face covering, and don\u2019t stay around and chat. Please don\u2019t invite other children or their parents to your home to play or stay indoors, even if they are in the same bubble at school. We need to continue to limit the numbers of people we meet socially to minimise spread of the virus. \"Please continue to work from home if at all possible. \"Current information on the Welsh Government restrictions for Coronavirus are available at https://gov.wales/coronavirus \"Recently the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and JCVI provided an update on the Oxford AstraZenca vaccine following reports of an extremely rare and specific type of blood clot following vaccination. \"The AstraZeneca vaccine remains safe and effective and has already saved thousands of lives. Those who have received a first dose of the vaccine, should continue to receive a second dose. \"The risk benefit remains strongly in favour of vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine for those aged 30 and over, and those aged under 30 who have underlying health conditions which puts them at higher risk of severe outcomes from Coronavirus infection. However, adults aged 18-29 years old who do not have underlying health conditions will now be offered an alternative vaccine. \"If you are contacted by your local TTP team then it is important that you are truthful with them about where you have been and who you have met. They are not there to judge, they are there to help prevent ongoing transmission of the virus and to protect the community. \"If you are asked to self-isolate by your local TTP team then please ensure that you do so for the full ten days \u2013 this will help break any chains of transmission. \"We urge anyone over 50 who has not yet received an invite for their vaccination to contact their local health board. Details of which can be found here: https://gov.wales/get-your-covid-19-vaccination-if-you-think-you-have-been-missed \"We encourage everyone, whatever their background, social demographic and ethnicity, to have the vaccine when they are offered it. \"Coronavirus cases by variant in Wales are reported on the UK Government website. The dominant strain in Wales is the Kent variant, and there is currently no evidence of widespread community transmission of other Variants of Concern in Wales. \"If you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test, either by calling 119 or by visiting www.gov.wales/getting-tested-coronavirus-covid-19. Please check your local health board\u2019s website to see if there are additional symptoms that require a test.\" Have your say on this story by using the comments section below.",

Officers and Wigan Council have been carrying out test purchasing of booze, using a child customer, to catch out a shop in Leigh which had been suspected of illegally selling liquor to Golborne minors. Police say there have been reductions in anti-social behaviour in many parts of Lowton and Golborne, but that has not been the case in Golborne town centre over recent weekends and this has included reports of young people throwing stones and other items at passing vehicles. Police are cracking down on youth nuisance in Golborne in several different ways A spokesperson for GMP Leigh, Atherton and Hindley said that following investigations two boys aged 14 had been arrested on suspicion of causing danger to road users and for attempted criminal damage. They have since been released on bail with conditions including an exclusion from part of Golborne and a curfew on Friday and Saturday evenings. And working on allegations that some of the trouble has been alcohol-fuelled, officers and trading standards had been carrying out test purchases at an unnamed Leigh store which led to the seizure of several items and enforcement action being taken against the owner. The spokesperson added: \u201cDisappointingly though it\u2019s become clear that in Golborne itself there are some adults buying alcohol and other items on behalf of young people from local shops. \"This is contributing to some of the anti-social behaviour, so there\u2019s a need for those individuals to reflect and consider their actions. \"Buying alcohol on behalf of a child in these circumstances is an offence under the Licensing Act 2003 so we will take action against anyone we find doing it.\u201d Officers are keen that fear of crimes is not exaggerated though, pointing out that over the recent bank holiday weekend there were only three allegations of anti-social behaviour in as many days."

They have since been released on bail with conditions including an exclusion from part of Golborne and a curfew on Friday and Saturday evenings. And working on allegations that some of the trouble has been alcohol-fuelled, officers and trading standards had been carrying out test purchases at an unnamed Leigh store which led to the seizure of several items and enforcement action being taken against the owner. The spokesperson added: \u201cDisappointingly though it\u2019s become clear that in Golborne itself there are some adults buying alcohol and other items on behalf of young people from local shops. \"This is contributing to some of the anti-social behaviour, so there\u2019s a need for those individuals to reflect and consider their actions. \"Buying alcohol on behalf of a child in these circumstances is an offence under the Licensing Act 2003 so we will take action against anyone we find doing it.\u201d Officers are keen that fear of crimes is not exaggerated though, pointing out that over the recent bank holiday weekend there were only three allegations of anti-social behaviour in as many days.",

A new cocktail bar is set to open above a popular Chester tapas bar in time for Christmas. Bar Gallo is opening above Porta Tapas on Northgate Street in early December. Porta Tapas owners Ben and Joe Wright, who are brothers, said they decided to open the bar to provide a welcome and warm place for customers to sit and enjoy a drink while waiting for a table at the tapas bar. Porta doesn't accept bookings and this has led to people queuing outside in the past due its popularity. But they then decided to open it up as a bar for anyone wanting to pop in just to have a drink. And they decided on the name Bar Gallo as a nod to the site's heritage as an 18th century tavern called the Hen and Chickens, but with a Spanish twist with gallo meaning cockerel. READ MORE: Chester's old Caf\u00e9 Rouge venue to be turned into new restaurant The Hen and Chickens tavern was a timber building which traded on the site in the 1700s according to the Chester Walls history and heritage website. It was said to have been a favourite spot for people to get a beer while watching hangings taking place outside Northgate gaol opposite. The Hen and Chickens is thought to be an unusual pub name and seen as a symbol of divine providence. It may have been so called due to its connections to the cathedral, with pilgrims possibly staying there. The site's historic hospitality links continued when the present building was an inn called The Grosvenor Arms known to be trading around 1840, pictured in the image from the Cheshire Image Bank below, which is dated around 1905. (Image: Cheshire Imagebank) Ben Wright said the new cocktail bar above Porta Tapas would have a cosy vibe, with dark wood and reclaimed furniture including pews from a church in Chester and rustic terracotta tiles around the bar. He told CheshireLive they hoped it would be a popular new addition to Chester's hospitality scene, with a range of drinks offered including Sangria, Basque cider and a short cocktail list of classics with a slight Spanish accent, including vermouth or vermut to give it its Spanish name. Ben said: \"We wanted to create a cosy bolthole continuing the Porta vibe for people waiting for a table and then we thought that we wanted it to be attractive for anyone to come along and have a drink. We'll be offering a short cocktail list and serving classics with a slight Spanish accent. \"We've got Spanish vermouth - vermut in Spanish - and we'll be doing quite a few of those cocktails. We will be doing understated cool cocktails including some nice takes on classic Martinis and some seasonal stuff and wintery bits and pieces.\" He added that they were proud to be a business based in such a historic city, saying: \"It's the thing we've always loved about being here in Chester. We are in a historic building in a location with a history of hospitality going back to the 1700s. \"It's great to think that people were doing something similar to what we are doing now back then. There used to be hangings on the other side of Northgate Street and this was apparently a popular place for people to get a beer and watch.\" Porta Tapas has proved so popular that it has spawned branches in Altrincham and Salford, and Porta in Chester was named by popular UK restaurant guide Hardens as one of the best in the city earlier this year. Bar Gallo will be open from 5pm to midnight six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday from early December, with the exact launch date to be announced soon.

A new cocktail bar is set to open above a popular Chester tapas bar in time for Christmas. Bar Gallo is opening above Porta Tapas on Northgate Street in early December. Porta Tapas owners Ben and Joe Wright, who are brothers, said they decided to open the bar to provide a welcome and warm place for customers to sit and enjoy a drink while waiting for a table at the tapas bar. Porta doesn't accept bookings and this has led to people queuing outside in the past due its popularity. But they then decided to open it up as a bar for anyone wanting to pop in just to have a drink. And they decided on the name Bar Gallo as a nod to the site's heritage as an 18th century tavern called the Hen and Chickens, but with a Spanish twist with gallo meaning cockerel. READ MORE: Chester's old Caf\u00e9 Rouge venue to be turned into new restaurant The Hen and Chickens tavern was a timber building which traded on the site in the 1700s according to the Chester Walls history and heritage website. It was said to have been a favourite spot for people to get a beer while watching hangings taking place outside Northgate gaol opposite. The Hen and Chickens is thought to be an unusual pub name and seen as a symbol of divine providence. It may have been so called due to its connections to the cathedral, with pilgrims possibly staying there. The site's historic hospitality links continued when the present building was an inn called The Grosvenor Arms known to be trading around 1840, pictured in the image from the Cheshire Image Bank below, which is dated around 1905. (Image: Cheshire Imagebank) Ben Wright said the new cocktail bar above Porta Tapas would have a cosy vibe, with dark wood and reclaimed furniture including pews from a church in Chester and rustic terracotta tiles around the bar. He told CheshireLive they hoped it would be a popular new addition to Chester's hospitality scene, with a range of drinks offered including Sangria, Basque cider and a short cocktail list of classics with a slight Spanish accent, including vermouth or vermut to give it its Spanish name. Ben said: \"We wanted to create a cosy bolthole continuing the Porta vibe for people waiting for a table and then we thought that we wanted it to be attractive for anyone to come along and have a drink. We'll be offering a short cocktail list and serving classics with a slight Spanish accent. \"We've got Spanish vermouth - vermut in Spanish - and we'll be doing quite a few of those cocktails. We will be doing understated cool cocktails including some nice takes on classic Martinis and some seasonal stuff and wintery bits and pieces.\" He added that they were proud to be a business based in such a historic city, saying: \"It's the thing we've always loved about being here in Chester. We are in a historic building in a location with a history of hospitality going back to the 1700s. \"It's great to think that people were doing something similar to what we are doing now back then. There used to be hangings on the other side of Northgate Street and this was apparently a popular place for people to get a beer and watch.\" Porta Tapas has proved so popular that it has spawned branches in Altrincham and Salford, and Porta in Chester was named by popular UK restaurant guide Hardens as one of the best in the city earlier this year. Bar Gallo will be open from 5pm to midnight six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday from early December, with the exact launch date to be announced soon.

But they then decided to open it up as a bar for anyone wanting to pop in just to have a drink. And they decided on the name Bar Gallo as a nod to the site's heritage as an 18th century tavern called the Hen and Chickens, but with a Spanish twist with gallo meaning cockerel. READ MORE: Chester's old Caf\u00e9 Rouge venue to be turned into new restaurant The Hen and Chickens tavern was a timber building which traded on the site in the 1700s according to the Chester Walls history and heritage website. It was said to have been a favourite spot for people to get a beer while watching hangings taking place outside Northgate gaol opposite. The Hen and Chickens is thought to be an unusual pub name and seen as a symbol of divine providence. It may have been so called due to its connections to the cathedral, with pilgrims possibly staying there. The site's historic hospitality links continued when the present building was an inn called The Grosvenor Arms known to be trading around 1840, pictured in the image from the Cheshire Image Bank below, which is dated around 1905. (Image: Cheshire Imagebank) Ben Wright said the new cocktail bar above Porta Tapas would have a cosy vibe, with dark wood and reclaimed furniture including pews from a church in Chester and rustic terracotta tiles around the bar. He told CheshireLive they hoped it would be a popular new addition to Chester's hospitality scene, with a range of drinks offered including Sangria, Basque cider and a short cocktail list of classics with a slight Spanish accent, including vermouth or vermut to give it its Spanish name. Ben said: \"We wanted to create a cosy bolthole continuing the Porta vibe for people waiting for a table and then we thought that we wanted it to be attractive for anyone to come along and have a drink. We'll be offering a short cocktail list and serving classics with a slight Spanish accent. \"We've got Spanish vermouth - vermut in Spanish - and we'll be doing quite a few of those cocktails. We will be doing understated cool cocktails including some nice takes on classic Martinis and some seasonal stuff and wintery bits and pieces.\" He added that they were proud to be a business based in such a historic city, saying: \"It's the thing we've always loved about being here in Chester. We are in a historic building in a location with a history of hospitality going back to the 1700s. \"It's great to think that people were doing something similar to what we are doing now back then. There used to be hangings on the other side of Northgate Street and this was apparently a popular place for people to get a beer and watch.\" Porta Tapas has proved so popular that it has spawned branches in Altrincham and Salford, and Porta in Chester was named by popular UK restaurant guide Hardens as one of the best in the city earlier this year. Bar Gallo will be open from 5pm to midnight six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday from early December, with the exact launch date to be announced soon.

He told CheshireLive they hoped it would be a popular new addition to Chester's hospitality scene, with a range of drinks offered including Sangria, Basque cider and a short cocktail list of classics with a slight Spanish accent, including vermouth or vermut to give it its Spanish name. Ben said: \"We wanted to create a cosy bolthole continuing the Porta vibe for people waiting for a table and then we thought that we wanted it to be attractive for anyone to come along and have a drink. We'll be offering a short cocktail list and serving classics with a slight Spanish accent. \"We've got Spanish vermouth - vermut in Spanish - and we'll be doing quite a few of those cocktails. We will be doing understated cool cocktails including some nice takes on classic Martinis and some seasonal stuff and wintery bits and pieces.\" He added that they were proud to be a business based in such a historic city, saying: \"It's the thing we've always loved about being here in Chester. We are in a historic building in a location with a history of hospitality going back to the 1700s. \"It's great to think that people were doing something similar to what we are doing now back then. There used to be hangings on the other side of Northgate Street and this was apparently a popular place for people to get a beer and watch.\" Porta Tapas has proved so popular that it has spawned branches in Altrincham and Salford, and Porta in Chester was named by popular UK restaurant guide Hardens as one of the best in the city earlier this year. Bar Gallo will be open from 5pm to midnight six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday from early December, with the exact launch date to be announced soon.

            "doc": "A woman from Ealing was a special guest at an exclusive preview screening of the new Black Panther: Wakanda Forever film as a thank-you for her support of a new NHS campaign to recruit more Black heritage blood donors. Siliana Coelho, 24, who is alive thanks to blood donors, was among 300 \u2018specially invited\u2019 NHS Blood and Transplant supporters attending the screening at Hackney Picturehouse. The NHS Blood and Transplant team partnered with the Marvel Studios film in the next stage in its \u2018Not Family, But Blood\u2019 campaign to encourage more people of Black heritage to donate blood to help sickle cell patients, amongst others. This is the NHS Blood and Transport\u2019s third film partnership with Disney and its second with Marvel Studios following collaborations with Free Guy in 2021 and Doctor Strange In the Multiverse. Siliana, from Ealing, shared her story for the campaign launch and explained that she \u2018would not be alive without donors\u2019 and why matched blood is so important. Siliana was diagnosed at birth and she describes sickle cell as dictating every part of her life. She experiences frequent episodes of excruciating pain. Her worst crisis came in 2018 when the sickle cells blocked the blood vessels in her lungs. She needed an emergency red cell exchange and spent three weeks in hospital. The following year she shared a video of herself experiencing an agonising crisis which went viral on Twitter. Siliana was joined at Thursday evening\u2019s screening by patients, donors and NHS Blood and Transplant partners and supporters. She said: \u201cIt was an amazing experience meeting all types of people coming together for one cause \u2013 to raise awareness of the urgent need for more Black heritage blood donors \u2013 while also reaping the rewards to enjoy it as one big community. \u201cGreat night, great people and more! It was also a great opportunity for people to find out their blood type and to spread the message about why ethnically matched blood is so important for people like me.\u201d Zeeshan Asghar, Head of Commercial Partnerships for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cWe were delighted to welcome Siliana to the preview screening as part of our collaboration with Marvel Studios\u2019 Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. We very much hope she enjoyed the event. \u201cBy sharing her story about living with sickle cell, Siliana has helped to raise awareness of the life-changing difference blood donors make \u2013 not only for herself but for the many other patients who rely on matched blood. \u201cWe hope that the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever collaboration will help us to reach a new Black audience with this powerful message, and encourage more people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage to become blood donors.\u201d The \u2018Not Family, But Blood\u2019 campaign generated record numbers of registrations from people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage when it launched in October. In the first day 884 people of Black heritage signing up to donate \u2013 the highest ever single day figure. During the first week there were 1,866 registrations from people of Black Caribbean and Black African heritage \u2013 a 700 percent uplift on the previous week. It is hoped the collaboration with Marvel Studios will further boost the campaign by reaching more people of Black heritage, particularly younger film fans who may not have considered blood donation. People aged 16-24 are especially needed as they are the donors of the future. The average age of Black heritage donors registering in the first week of the campaign was 31. The \u2018Not Family But Blood\u2019 NHS campaign highlights that although the Black community is diverse, one unifying thing is the power to provide life-changing blood donations. This thought is amplified in the people of Wakanda \u2013 different tribes, but together they are stronger, supporting and protecting their community. Ethnically matched blood provides the best treatment for sickle cell and more Black heritage donors are urgently needed to meet increasing demand. Hospitals in England now need 250 donations every day to treat sickle cell compared with 150 five years ago. Dr Farrukh Shah, Medical Director of Transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cThe critical shortage of blood donations from people of a Black heritage means many sickle cell patients often receive less well-matched blood. \u201cWhile this is clinically suitable, it can pose a longer-term risk to patients who receive regular transfusions. We urgently need more Black heritage donors to come forward. Giving blood is quick, easy and safe.\u201d"

Her worst crisis came in 2018 when the sickle cells blocked the blood vessels in her lungs. She needed an emergency red cell exchange and spent three weeks in hospital. The following year she shared a video of herself experiencing an agonising crisis which went viral on Twitter. Siliana was joined at Thursday evening\u2019s screening by patients, donors and NHS Blood and Transplant partners and supporters. She said: \u201cIt was an amazing experience meeting all types of people coming together for one cause \u2013 to raise awareness of the urgent need for more Black heritage blood donors \u2013 while also reaping the rewards to enjoy it as one big community. \u201cGreat night, great people and more! It was also a great opportunity for people to find out their blood type and to spread the message about why ethnically matched blood is so important for people like me.\u201d Zeeshan Asghar, Head of Commercial Partnerships for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cWe were delighted to welcome Siliana to the preview screening as part of our collaboration with Marvel Studios\u2019 Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. We very much hope she enjoyed the event. \u201cBy sharing her story about living with sickle cell, Siliana has helped to raise awareness of the life-changing difference blood donors make \u2013 not only for herself but for the many other patients who rely on matched blood. \u201cWe hope that the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever collaboration will help us to reach a new Black audience with this powerful message, and encourage more people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage to become blood donors.\u201d The \u2018Not Family, But Blood\u2019 campaign generated record numbers of registrations from people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage when it launched in October. In the first day 884 people of Black heritage signing up to donate \u2013 the highest ever single day figure. During the first week there were 1,866 registrations from people of Black Caribbean and Black African heritage \u2013 a 700 percent uplift on the previous week. It is hoped the collaboration with Marvel Studios will further boost the campaign by reaching more people of Black heritage, particularly younger film fans who may not have considered blood donation. People aged 16-24 are especially needed as they are the donors of the future. The average age of Black heritage donors registering in the first week of the campaign was 31. The \u2018Not Family But Blood\u2019 NHS campaign highlights that although the Black community is diverse, one unifying thing is the power to provide life-changing blood donations. This thought is amplified in the people of Wakanda \u2013 different tribes, but together they are stronger, supporting and protecting their community. Ethnically matched blood provides the best treatment for sickle cell and more Black heritage donors are urgently needed to meet increasing demand. Hospitals in England now need 250 donations every day to treat sickle cell compared with 150 five years ago. Dr Farrukh Shah, Medical Director of Transfusion for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cThe critical shortage of blood donations from people of a Black heritage means many sickle cell patients often receive less well-matched blood. \u201cWhile this is clinically suitable, it can pose a longer-term risk to patients who receive regular transfusions. We urgently need more Black heritage donors to come forward. Giving blood is quick, easy and safe.\u201d",

Aracadia, famed for brands including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis had been teetering on the brink of collapse over the weekend, putting 13,000 jobs in jeopardy. Now, in a statement from administrators Deloitte, it's been confirmed. \u201cNo redundancies are being announced today as a result of the appointment and stores will continue to trade,\" they said. \u201cThe Joint Administrators are assessing all options available to the Group. \"The administrators will be honouring all online orders made over the Black Friday weekend and will continue to be operating all the existing sale channels of the business.\u201d The group - acquired by Sir Philip Green for \u00a3850million in 2002 - has been attempting to find extra cash for a number of weeks. But despite the pandemic being blamed for the shortfall, a business-saving \u00a330million emergency loan last week was not forthcoming. The fashion retail empire comprises 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough. Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia, said: \u201cThis is an incredibly sad day for all of our colleagues as well as our suppliers and our many other stakeholders. \u201cThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands. \u201cThroughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side. \u201cUltimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.\u201d Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \u201cWe will now work with the existing management team and broader stakeholders to assess all options available for the future of the group\u2019s businesses. \u201cIt is our intention to continue to trade all of the brands, and we look forward to welcoming customers back into stores when many of them are allowed to reopen. \u201cWe will be rapidly seeking expressions of interest and expect to identify one or more buyers to ensure the future success of the businesses. \u201cAs administrators we\u2019d like to thank all of the group\u2019s employees, customers and business partners for their support, at what we appreciate is a difficult time.\u201d Just last year, a restructuring deal saw 50 store closures and 1,000 jobs cut, but these savings were to prove inadequate. The Mirror reports that Arcadia is expected to enter \"light-touch\" trading administration, which means management will retain all control of the day-to-day running of the business while administrators will seek a buyer for all or parts of the company. Earlier on Monday, Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group said an offer for a \u00a350 million lifeline for Arcadia was rejected. It came as MPs called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group\u2019s workers. Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on the tycoon to stump up funds to fill the pensions black hole, which is estimated to be as large as \u00a3350 million. (Image: Daily Mirror) It is the latest retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the coronavirus pandemic. Rivals including Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group and Oasis Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March. Earlier this year, the group revealed plans to cut around 500 of its 2,500 head office jobs amid a restructure in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Frasers Group, which runs Sports Direct, told the London Stock Exchange earlier on Monday that a \u00a350 million loan aimed at keeping Arcadia afloat had been rejected. The company said: \u201cFrasers Group can confirm that Arcadia Group Limited have declined Frasers Group\u2019s offer of a lifeline loan of up to \u00a350 million. \u201cFrasers Group were not given any reasons for the rejection, nor did Frasers Group have any engagement from Arcadia before the loan was declined.\u201d"

The United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust (ULHT), which runs facilities in Lincoln, Boston, Grantham and Louth, confirmed the news on Thursday, April 14. Andrew Morgan, the Chief Executive of the trust, said: \"Our hospitals are continuing to see exceptionally high levels of demand for our services, along with the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, and our emergency diagnostic capacity being reduced as a result of the recent fire. We are continuing to work with our system partners to prioritise those in most urgent need of hospital treatment and urge people to get medical help when they need it for non life-threatening issues by using NHS 111 online.\" The declaration of a critical incident means that other hospitals and ambulance services are aware of the pressure that Lincolnshire's facilities are under, and it came after a similar incident was declared in January. That incident eventually led to members of the Armed Forces assisting at ULHT's facilities, primarily at Lincoln and Boston.

On this occasion, the trust said that people should continue to come forward for care. Mr Morgan added: \"Despite the current demand, essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them so if you require emergency medical help, please continue to come forward.\" A spokesperson for ULHT confirmed the critical incident has now been stood down.

Andrew Morgan, the Chief Executive of the trust, said: \"Our hospitals are continuing to see exceptionally high levels of demand for our services, along with the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, and our emergency diagnostic capacity being reduced as a result of the recent fire.

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:"

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East.

The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup.

It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing.

It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words.

I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy.

It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing.

It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words.

I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy.

It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing.

It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words.

I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy.

It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing.

It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

The weather might be bleak but training prevents Simpson from slipping into a darker place. \"It\u2019s difficult to keep going, it\u2019s easier when you have a teammate or an ex-teammate with you,\" Simpson told the Manchester Evening News . \" I\u2019ve got all this free time and sometimes I think I could just go to the pub, but my little girl keeps me going.\" Simpson's daughter, Skye, and his mental resilience keep him going on the difficult days when he wonders whether he will return to football. He's now 35 and without a club, not retired, after leaving Championship side Bristol City earlier this year. ALSO READ: What it's like to work under United manager Ten Hag It's been a long, winding road for Simpson to get here, with many unbelievable highs and some lows. Simpson was born in Salford, he dreamed of playing for Manchester United and he achieved that childhood ambition when making his debut in 2007. \"I joined United's academy aged 11 or 12 and I was always a defender because I just loved tackling and defending,\" Simpson said. \"I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be six foot two, so I got pushed to right-back and I had to start learning how to play in that position. \"It was one of the best educations. The people at the club, the way it was run, it came from Sir Alex all the way down and just learning about a good person and values, that was always mentioned. It wasn\u2019t just about on the pitch, it was about off it as well. \"I remember my first trip to America, it was the Dallas Cup. Going as a team going to the rodeos, going to different stadiums and all of those different experiences and playing a tournament over there, was an incredible experience as a kid from Eccles.\" Simpson has proved people wrong his entire life and that started in the academy. The majority of players his age were released during the Under-14s stage, but the club retained three youngsters and he was among them, with staff wanting to give him more time to develop. \"I had to stay down a year because I was too small and they wanted to give me another chance to see if I could grow,\" he added. \"I ended up staying with the year below me, the likes of Fraizer Campbell, Ryan Shawcross and Jonny Evans.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) Simpson made his first-team debut against Coventry in the League Cup in September 2007 before making his Premier League debut at Old Trafford just a few weeks later, when he came on as a substitute for John O'Shea in the 30th minute and assisted Wayne Rooney for United's fourth goal in a 4-0 win. \"I wanted to play football since I was seven, I supported United growing up, so to actually play at Old Trafford, to make your debut with all your friends and family there, is everyone\u2019s dream. I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words.

I knew I had achieved my dream but I wanted more. \"I'll never forget my actual debut in the Premier League when I set up Wayne Rooney against Wigan. Every striker that makes their debut wants to score at the Stretford End, so the nearest I could get to that was crossing it for Rooney.\" Simpson's journey to making his first-team debut was not a straightforward one. He was loaned to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland before getting his chance and he later had stints with Ipswich Town, Blackburn and Newcastle during his time at the club. United had developed a partnership with Royal Antwerp and Simpson was aged just 19 when he packed his bags for Europe. Antwerp were managed by Warren Joyce when he joined, which helped, but the move was a steep learning curve for a young player. \"It\u2019s the experience that I\u2019ve got which means I can help other players,\" Simpson said. \"You leave your family and you begin to understand how the foreign players in England feel. It made me appreciate them and what they go through. \"Being around a different language daily, the driving on the other side of the road, the food, the training methods, everything was an experience in growing up to become a mature player, so you could return to England as a better version of yourself.\" (Image: 2007 Manchester United) What would he say to any young players who are considering a move abroad? \"I\u2019d say go because you\u2019re coming out of your comfort zone,\" Simpson says without hesitation. \"Sometimes if you\u2019re here in Manchester, your friends or family might be telling you everything is great, but when you go abroad, you have to mature and you haven\u2019t got your friends around the corner. \"You learn so much, it's senior football and a different way of playing, different styles and I\u2019d always say go for it.\" Simpson achieved promotion from the Championship with Sunderland in 2007 and he achieved the same with Newcastle, who signed him on a loan in August 2009 before making a bid to make the deal permanent in the following January transfer window. It was an exciting move to a 'huge club', but he felt mixed emotions at the switch to the North East. \"Newcastle is a massive club, I couldn\u2019t turn that down and it looked like we were on our way to the Premier League,\" Simpson reflected. \"I had mixed emotions at the time. I was already with Newcastle, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to say my goodbyes at United or get a chance to walk around, but I knew it was the next step in my career, 50,000 fans every week, with mad passionate Geordies. \"I was leaving my boyhood club and that was difficult, yes, but ultimately, I wanted to have a career in the Premier League and I definitely made the right choice. I look at Newcastle now and what they're doing and it brings back memories for me. \"You see Newcastle in the top four this year and that was us in the 2011/12 season. When I look back now, I actually think it was a big achievement, to finish fifth in the Premier League and to reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League. \"It\u2019s not really until this season that I\u2019ve appreciated that and really thought about it. My daughter was born there, I\u2019ve still got friends up there still and it was a big four years of my life, to be honest.\" (Image: 2012 Getty Images) Simpson laughed as he recalled he 'always had good games' when playing against United, which included when Newcastle defeated Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0 at St. James' Park in the legendary manager's penultimate season at Old Trafford. \"That was on my birthday and it will go down as one of my favourite nights,\" Simpson said. \"Yohan [Cabaye] scored an amazing free-kick and I think we were just on it that night, everyone was. I always had good games against United for Newcastle. \"I also cleared one off the line at Old Trafford to prevent Chicharito from scoring and I got a little clip around the ear from Sir Alex for that. Another game was 4-3 on Boxing Day, we were winning, then drawing and winning - it was a crazy game. \"Newcastle was probably where I started to show that I could comfortably play week in, week out in the Premier League.\" Simpson made 138 appearances for Newcastle, the most for any club he's played for, but he eventually wanted a new challenge and joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 on a free transfer after declining a new deal in the North East. The right-back made the decision to drop to the Championship to sign for QPR, who were promoted in his first and only season in West London. Simpson spent just 12 months with QPR and he was on the move again to Leicester in August 2014. Nigel Pearson, who Simpson has a 'father-son relationship' with, brought him to Leicester that summer and the Foxes narrowly avoided relegation in a tumultuous first season back in the Premier League. It was a miraculous achievement to avoid relegation, having been bottom at Christmas, but what lay next after Pearson was sacked nobody could have predicted, with Leicester appointing Claudio Ranieri, who led them to a fairytale Premier League title. Leicester achieved the impossible that season. They defied 5,000/1 odds and made unthinkable history, an achievement which is almost certain never to be emulated, and Simpson made 30 starts in the Premier League at right-back. \"We had a togetherness that was built over the years through Nigel Pearson,\" Simpson said. \"When I came into the group it was evident to see they were very close and then the quality was added, like with N\u2019Golo Kante, who was a freak of nature. \"Kante is one the best players I\u2019ve ever seen. Riyad [Mahrez], played on the right ahead of me and Jamie Vardy came out of nowhere and was on fire. We didn\u2019t want to give up and we believed, which I think is the word for that season: belief. (Image: 2016 Getty Images) \"Ranieri didn\u2019t think I was for him at the start. You have to either walk away or try to change their opinion, but luckily for me, I decided to stay and prove him wrong. He realised I could play a big part and obviously I managed to do that.\" Simpson said he 'always has something to prove to Sir Alex' while playing for Newcastle, but he buried that hatchet when winning the Premier League. It was an unfathomable success and something that Simpson struggles to put into words even now, as he paused and carefully collected his thoughts before attempting to describe exactly what it felt like to win the Premier League that year. \"It\u2019s still hard to put it into words. You look at the league and think how did we go from relegation to that,\" he said. \"After leaving a club like Manchester United, you\u2019re not thinking about winning the Premier League, you just want to have a decent career. \"To do that, proving people wrong and believing in yourself, was unbelievable. On the Monday night when we won it, I was in the back garden in tears, just full of emotion. It was a bit of a surreal moment. The whole thing, I wish I could go back to it. \"When we came together that night, we were screaming, crying and grabbing each other, not even saying any words. It was very emotional and that\u2019s when the drinks came out. We were celebrating in our own little cloud.\" Simpson discussed the 'togetherness' of that Leicester side and he still has strong friendships from that squad. In the middle of the interview, he received a message from Leicester's captain that season, Wes Morgan, who remains a close friend. Leicester played in the Champions League after their Premier League triumph and Simpson earned the opportunity to play in Porto, Brugge and Copenhagen. Leicester excelled but Atletico Madrid eventually proved to be a step too far in the quarter-finals. \"I'm still proudest about that period, It was a dream,\" Simpson said. \"This is what kids now, watching the World Cup and playing football in the park, dream about and I managed to live it. It\u2019s something I can always be happy with.\" (Image: 2016 Getty Images) Simpson spent five years at Leicester and he finally bade farewell to the King Power Stadium in June 2019. He then spent the 2019/20 season with Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The pandemic had begun and Simpson was forced to have surgery on a thigh issue towards the end of the season, which was followed by a lonely rehabilitation period at home without the safety net of a club environment, which made him stare retirement in the face. Simpson remained mentally strong in his recovery. He was hungry to return and was eventually offered help from Leicester and the PFA, who paid for a stay at St George's Park, which came shortly before Pearson was appointed as Bristol City's manager. After re-signing for Pearson at Bristol City on a free transfer in March 2021 until the end of the season, Simpson's determination was rewarded with a one-year extension, but he struggled to 'settle' at Ashton Gate and left by mutual consent earlier this year. \"You get to a point when you\u2019re 34 or 35 and you want to play. It doesn\u2019t matter who are you, look at Ronaldo now, he\u2019s 37,\" Simpson explained. \"Some people are happy sitting on the bench at a club and some people aren't and that\u2019s me. \"Nigel is a top man and it just didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s difficult because I know I can still play, I haven\u2019t actually retired. I'll know when the time is right, but I\u2019ll give it to January and make the right calls. You can\u2019t just sit around waiting forever.\" Simpson has been without a club for nine months and he's dealt with 'good and bad days' throughout the year. He's still training, putting in the work and maintaining his fitness, but he admitted that it's mentally challenging to do each day. \"It\u2019s hard, but even more so when you have a week off and you don\u2019t do it,\" Simpson said. \"I\u2019ve been to the gym this morning and I know I'll feel ready to attack the day after the session, but then when you\u2019re on your own, it\u2019s very difficult. \"I saw all my friends go back to their clubs in the summer and it affects you mentally. When you see them back in training, I didn\u2019t even want to go on my Instagram because I was sick and tired. I know it sounds bad but I couldn\u2019t like their pictures. (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) \"I was struggling mentally and there wasn\u2019t much help. I was lucky because eventually I grew a pair of balls and rang Leicester and I asked whether I could come back in and train and they let me, but some people don\u2019t have that relationship with clubs. \"You\u2019re trying to find a pitch to train on. It\u2019s difficult to just go to David Lloyds on a treadmill with people around you, asking 'what are you doing here'. We found a pitch in Knutsford, because Danny Drinkwater knew the owner, but it\u2019s difficult for players to find coaches to try and train one-on-one, especially when you're out of contract and not knowing whether anyone will give you a call.\" A candid Simpson then laid bare the reality of what it's actually like for some players in football who are out of contract and struggling. \"I\u2019ve got a WhatsApp group, some who are ex-players and some who haven't retired, and our mates ring each other every other day just to keep each other going, to see they are getting on because we\u2019re all in the same boat,\" Simpson said. \"We don\u2019t know what to do. I try to do my punditry and my radio, but it doesn't happen overnight. It\u2019s a crazy transition and some that finish football will get a divorce, they might be gambling or drinking, a lot of stuff goes on that people don\u2019t really know about. \"Our phones should be ringing. Some people might not have great friends or good relationships with their families, they might not have wives or kids, and they might know what they\u2019re doing. The only thing that keeps me going is my little girl. \"I want to keep training and I don\u2019t want to fall back into that place. I just think there could be programmes in place, or even courtesy calls, just to check where people are in life. It\u2019s not on the clubs that have released you, that club will continue. \"You might have people that keep an eye on you like I\u2019ve got someone at Leicester, who's the welfare officer called Dale, and she\u2019s amazing. She rings me once a week, but I don't think that happens elsewhere. It helps, so I\u2019m sure that can help other people.\" (Image: @dannysimpson via Instagram) So, what is the solution? During his time without a club, it has struck Simpson that there is such little support for professional players who are in their later years, or who are simply without a contract, and he's now trying to influence change. Simpson has begun talks with the Premier League about better support away from the pitch and he's discussed the idea of a league-funded centre for players who are out of contract, somewhere that is officially organised with training facilities. \"I think mentally and physically when you stop getting paid and you stop having a routine, it\u2019s dangerous,\" Simpson said. \"I've highlighted the problems to the Premier League and they think it's a really good idea to address it. \"They liked the idea that there should be like a sports academy or a set up where out-of-contract players, of all ages, can go to these training camps, as those players can get together, stay fit and have a record of the work they've been doing. \"Then when you find a club, they can ask what have you been doing to keep fit and you can say 'yeah, the training camp'. Now, clubs ring me and say what are you doing, and I say 'yeah I go to the gym every day and play football', but there\u2019s no proof. \"The Premier League like the idea, so hopefully something can happen in the future, even if it\u2019s not for me, then for others.\" Simpson is fighting for a better future for his colleagues and the Premier League makes enough millions to take care of players who are out of contract. Not every player has a support network of family and friends, or a daughter like Simpson, who he thinks about during those cold December mornings when he doesn't know when the phone will ring next. Simpson has proved people wrong throughout his career - he's now trying to make a point to the Premier League. READ NEXT:",

Nicola was aged just 18 when she disappeared in December 1991 as she walked home from her boyfriend\u2019s house across a patch of land known as the Black Pad. There was a huge investigation and numerous searches across Coventry \u2013 but she was never found. There have been searches over the years, but now a new search is focusing on a mile-long stretch of the Oxford Canal, just outside Rugby. It comes after a new piece of information that has been described as \"a bit of a breakthrough\". So who are the people carrying out the search? SGI\u2019s website describes them as a \u2018world leader\u2019 in the fields of specialist rescue, underwater search, forensic search and protester removal. They\u2019ve helped in the search for Nicola Payne before, when Coombe Country Park was an area of interest in 2018. They work with police, fire and other government agencies and were founded in 1995 by Peter Faulding. SGI has the only private underwater forensic search team approved for police operations in the UK. Mr Faulding is regarded as one of the world\u2019s leading confined space rescue and forensic search specialists. He\u2019s worked on high profile missing person cases before \u2013 including five-year-old April Jones and serial killer Peter Tobin among others. The search for Nicola will continue today, with dive teams first focusing on a short stretch of water leading off the main Oxford Canal. SGI will also be using high frequency side-scan sonar in the search. You can follow the latest updates here.",

Peter Swains' letter criticised the council's lack of initiative in ensuring that Bournemouth town centre can still \"attract visitors\". Many readers agreed with the letter and explained why they think the town is slowly deteriorating. The controversial topic of free parking was frequently touched upon, with many readers highlighting the high prices of parking in Bournemouth. Grace Hamilton commented: \"Business rents being sky high and parking charges are the problem. Personally, I avoid the town centre like the plague.\" Steve Mcquade added: \"Take a trip to any retail park where free parking is offered, and the motorist is welcomed (e.g. Castlepoint) and you can see that online shopping is NOT the main problem!\" However, some readers do not seem to think that free parking will solve the problem of the high street's decline. Garry Mann explained: \"Free parking is not the answer as it will probably end up abused. Free parking on the weekends should encourage more people to visit the town.\" Despite the parking in Bournemouth being a bone of contention amongst many of our readers, others highlighted the issues surrounding the town itself and how it differs to other successful high streets. Janice Lewis said: \"Comments on here are repeatedly citing car park charges and online shopping, but queues of cars flock to Southampton to shop! Car park charges in West Quay are high, but the car park is often full. There is a fab choice of shops and eateries (unlike Bournemouth). \"Bournemouth Council really need to start employing someone worth those expensive salaries who can inject some 21 Century life into the town and clean it up.\" Rebecca Richardson also highlighted the significance of business rates, amongst other things. She commented: \"I like Bournemouth town centre! Love the gardens and love BH2, but I hate the smell of weed all the time and the anti-social behaviour. It's not a nice place to be in the evening. \"Cheaper business rates are needed to attract the big stores back as there\u2019s not a lot left anymore.\" Our readers also mentioned their preference of alternative shopping locations, such as Wimborne and West Quay in Southampton, detailing how they would much rather travel further afield than visit what's on their doorstep. Mark Holdgate explained: \"Depending on the time of day, I can drive to Southampton faster than I can get into Bournemouth from Corfe Mullen. That's before I even consider the issues of parking in the town centre. \"There needs to be better transport infrastructure between Bournemouth and Poole and frankly, we need more diverse shops as well.\" Christine Lepine added: \"I don\u2019t go to Bournemouth much at all - I prefer Wimborne and Ringwood, where they have more diverse shops and cheaper parking. I also travel to Winchester, West Quay and Gunwharf.\" Many have noticed the changes to the town centre over the years, and do not want these changes to continue damaging the high street. Madeleine Murphy said: \"It's so sad to see how it has deteriorated since we moved here 17 years ago. It needs a combined plan by all agencies, council, police, community groups to push forward the changes that are necessary for the town to survive. \"Retail is changing and so will our town centres. The good will survive, let Bournemouth be one of them.\" Another reader emphasised the evident changes to the town over the years and how it has impacted the appeal to visit and purchase from the high street. \"I hate and detest Bournemouth, it\u2019s a filthy, squalid and greedy place,\" said James Kellard. He added: \"When I was a boy, growing up there in the 1960's and 70's I loved it, but that Bournemouth is little more than a memory now.\" With shops rapidly disappearing from the Bournemouth town centre, there are many factors that could be attributed to its deterioration. Parking charges, presentation, lack of independent shops and business rates were frequently mentioned by our readers. It is clear from the near 400 comments on our Facebook post that our readers desperately want things to change and improve, for the sake of the town and for those who still visit and earn a living from it."

Despite a huge search of the prison, which included bringing specialists in to check the drains, the keys have not been found. HMP Doncaster. Both the Ministry of Justice and South Yorkshire Police have been informed of the incident. Jerry Spencer, Prison Director at HMP Doncaster, said: \u201cHMP Doncaster has additional measures in place until the security issue from last week is resolved. \u201cThe incident has been referred to the police so it would be inappropriate to comment further at the moment.\u201d A number of locks at the prison are to be replaced as a precaution to maintain security. Last week, an inspection report was published, which raised concerns about overcrowding, violence, deaths and drugs at the prison. HMP Doncaster, a category B jail and young offender institution, which holds around 1,100 criminals, was inspected last September. Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, praised the \u2018consistent leadership\u2019 and some improved facilities at the prison but said he was \u2018very concerned by the increased levels of self-harm\u2019 at the prison and referred to five self-inflicted deaths in the year leading up to the inspection and another shortly afterwards. He said levels of violence were higher than were noted at the previous inspection and he revealed that 61 per cent of prisoners said it was easy to get hold of drugs. The inspection found that around 700 inmates were doubled up in cells designed for one. Mr Clarke added: \u201cThis dangerous combination of ready availability of drugs, lack of any meaningful way to pass the time, and overcrowding will obviously give rise to tensions and frustration, particularly with such a young population. \u201cAs such, it was hardly surprising that at times staff struggled to maintain control."

After back-to-back 7-0 home losses in his first two games in charge, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Wick Academy, Connelly was encouraged by the performance in the defeat to Formartine at Mosset Park. A sixth minute goal from Stuart Smith was enough to give the visitors the three points, but the Cans competed well throughout. Connelly said: \"So many pluses have come out of the game. \"You can see their fitness levels have improved since we came in and that was a big issue. \"And I actually think the players enjoyed it. They gave us energy, we've just not got the luck in front of goals but I can't fault the effort.\" Midfielder Jack Maley, formerly of Rothes, was a new face in the starting line-up for Mechanics, who were behind early on. A Kevin Hanratty cross was headed in at the near post by Formartine defender Stuart Smith to give the visitors the advantage. Forres' first chance came after 18 minutes, with new man Maley finding Callum Johnston whose shot was almost let slip by Ewan Macdonald. Moments later Jack Grant knocked just wide at the near post after a Dale Wood cross. Graeme Rodger had a couple of chances for the visitors before the break, with their best chance coming courtesy of Kevin Hanratty, but his shot was brilliantly blocked by Graham Fraser. Into the second half and the Cans scrapped away, with Lee Fraser's shot at the end of a good counter attack being blocked on the hour mark. Goalkeeper Lee Herbert had to be sharp to deny Rodger on 70 minutes, while substitute Jonny Smith headed just wide for Formartine on 84 minutes. Smith had the ball in the net from a free-kick three minutes later but was adjudged to have been in an offside position. The final chance fell the way of Daniel Park, who cut inside from 25 yards and fired a well-hit effort into the sidenetting. Mechanics have now lost four in a row under their new management team, without scoring. A trip to Strathspey Thistle on Saturday, before a home tie with Fort William after Christmas, gives the Cans the chance to change that. Connelly added: \"There are no easy games. The pyramid system has switched all teams on to the fear of losing and going down because there might not be a route back. \"We don't have the right to beat anybody. Strathspey were unlucky at Wick so they'll be a tough game. \"But it's one we go into with a bit of confidence so we'll hope to build on that.\""

Goblin mode was voted for by 318,956 people, when Oxford took it to a public vote along with metaverse and #IStandWith and the winner was announced earlier this week. Apparently, this neologism encapsulates 2022\u2019s trend towards being a slattern, or a slut, as my mum would say, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. Goblin gang The phrase has been around for a few years, but went viral, back in February, after being used in a fake news story about Kanye West and Julia Fox\u2019s break-up, and even Elon Musk has used it since. Oxford defines it as \u201ca type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations\u201d. It seems that lockdown altered our habits and, as the world continued on its increasingly chaotic axis, we doubled down into our goblin bunkers. This was in part a rebellion against the post lockdown pressure to go out and enjoy ourselves. It\u2019s like being a budgie. They unlock the cage and unlatch the window, but sometimes you don\u2019t want to fly free, especially when you\u2019ve got some cuttlefish and a mirror with a bell on it. Also, there are cats outside and they might want to eat a pretty boy. We\u2019ve watched gobbledygook on our phones, binged on junk food, haven\u2019t bothered washing or styling our hair in the usual signature pompadour, stayed in bed all day, and relinquished any semblance of perfection. It\u2019s an ambition-free YOLO of sorts, when you bin the bucket list and fill it with H\u00e4agen-Dazs instead. Your carpe diem has decided to carpe die. I\u2019m certainly not seizing anything, unless it\u2019s warm or edible. If anyone dared to ring the doorbell or phone, we\u2019d growl \u201cwho\u2019s that trip-trapping over my bridge?\u201d. Or maybe that\u2019s the trolls who say that, while taking a break between posting supportive comments online. Apparently, the goblin trend is a partial backlash to the images of perfection that have proliferated on social media over the past few years. The annoying sprites, who show us their green smoothies, perfect homes and shiny hair, are becoming extinct. Good. Don\u2019t slam the cottage-core door on your way out. Even if it\u2019s considered an ephemeral lifestyle trend, I feel that I\u2019ve always been in goblin mode. Essentially, since birth, when I popped out as a tiny goblet. I keep up appearances outside the house. There\u2019s the make-up and brushed hair, matching shoes and absence of egg yolk stains. I have a handbag that\u2019s very smart from the outside, but inside \u2013 total goblin mode. There\u2019s an unwrapped boiled sweet stuck to the lining. As soon as I return to my lair, the pyjamas are immediately deployed from their traditionally Scottish under-the-pillow spot. I used to have a strict 5pm curfew on that outfit, but it\u2019s edged ever earlier over the past couple of years. That became permissible when they started marketing it as loungewear. If I ever have a night out planned, and it gets cancelled, my first thought is always \u2018excellent\u2019. I know I am not unique in that respect. There is no pleasure greater than having zero on your schedule. When the working day is done, you can transform into your true self \u2013 a gibbering blob. I think women especially are taught from a young age to constantly observe themselves, as an outsider would. This still happens to me sometimes, mainly when I\u2019m in public. However, the indoor internal voice will occasionally pipe up. That\u2019s usually to say \u201cwould you just look at yourself\u201d, as I lie on the sofa, under a heap of mismatched clothes, with Marmite on my face and my specs smudged with fingerprints, so they render everything in Emmanuelle soft focus. \u201cYou absolutely disgust me,\u201d they will say. \u201cThis is SO aspirational.\u201d Sarcastic. As I get older, that voice gets more muffled. I think it might be buried under the cushions. Probably suffocated. What a shame. I\u2019ll run and get my defibrillator. See, I can be sarcastic too. Since I am also married to a goblin, or a bogeyman at least, there is less household pressure to look presentable or do any Hyacinth Bucket-ing. As the only person in Scotland to like American football, his happy place involves eating nachos in a bobble hat and dressing gown while watching the San Francisco 49ers. At this time of year, the inclination towards our mutual goblin-hood intensifies. Since the central heating is so expensive, I spend more time in my bed, with the electric blanket on. I\u2019ve given up trying to moderate my phone time, and my diet has gone to pot. Generally, though, I don\u2019t feel too guilty. We\u2019re sold the idea that a healthy mind and body is achieved through meditation, self improvement, exercise, positive affirmations and a nutritious diet. I do a bit of all of those things. They\u2019re effective, if occasionally expensive, but perhaps being a goblin can fall into the self care category too. As Christmas approaches, I\u2019d like to suggest we take it a step further, and go into Gremlin mode, except we WILL be fed after midnight. I predict a couple of weeks of mince-pie-scoffing and slipper wearing abandon."

I\u2019m certainly not seizing anything, unless it\u2019s warm or edible. If anyone dared to ring the doorbell or phone, we\u2019d growl \u201cwho\u2019s that trip-trapping over my bridge?\u201d. Or maybe that\u2019s the trolls who say that, while taking a break between posting supportive comments online. Apparently, the goblin trend is a partial backlash to the images of perfection that have proliferated on social media over the past few years. The annoying sprites, who show us their green smoothies, perfect homes and shiny hair, are becoming extinct. Good. Don\u2019t slam the cottage-core door on your way out. Even if it\u2019s considered an ephemeral lifestyle trend, I feel that I\u2019ve always been in goblin mode. Essentially, since birth, when I popped out as a tiny goblet. I keep up appearances outside the house. There\u2019s the make-up and brushed hair, matching shoes and absence of egg yolk stains. I have a handbag that\u2019s very smart from the outside, but inside \u2013 total goblin mode. There\u2019s an unwrapped boiled sweet stuck to the lining. As soon as I return to my lair, the pyjamas are immediately deployed from their traditionally Scottish under-the-pillow spot. I used to have a strict 5pm curfew on that outfit, but it\u2019s edged ever earlier over the past couple of years. That became permissible when they started marketing it as loungewear. If I ever have a night out planned, and it gets cancelled, my first thought is always \u2018excellent\u2019. I know I am not unique in that respect. There is no pleasure greater than having zero on your schedule. When the working day is done, you can transform into your true self \u2013 a gibbering blob. I think women especially are taught from a young age to constantly observe themselves, as an outsider would. This still happens to me sometimes, mainly when I\u2019m in public. However, the indoor internal voice will occasionally pipe up. That\u2019s usually to say \u201cwould you just look at yourself\u201d, as I lie on the sofa, under a heap of mismatched clothes, with Marmite on my face and my specs smudged with fingerprints, so they render everything in Emmanuelle soft focus. \u201cYou absolutely disgust me,\u201d they will say. \u201cThis is SO aspirational.\u201d Sarcastic. As I get older, that voice gets more muffled. I think it might be buried under the cushions. Probably suffocated. What a shame. I\u2019ll run and get my defibrillator. See, I can be sarcastic too. Since I am also married to a goblin, or a bogeyman at least, there is less household pressure to look presentable or do any Hyacinth Bucket-ing. As the only person in Scotland to like American football, his happy place involves eating nachos in a bobble hat and dressing gown while watching the San Francisco 49ers. At this time of year, the inclination towards our mutual goblin-hood intensifies. Since the central heating is so expensive, I spend more time in my bed, with the electric blanket on. I\u2019ve given up trying to moderate my phone time, and my diet has gone to pot. Generally, though, I don\u2019t feel too guilty. We\u2019re sold the idea that a healthy mind and body is achieved through meditation, self improvement, exercise, positive affirmations and a nutritious diet. I do a bit of all of those things. They\u2019re effective, if occasionally expensive, but perhaps being a goblin can fall into the self care category too. As Christmas approaches, I\u2019d like to suggest we take it a step further, and go into Gremlin mode, except we WILL be fed after midnight. I predict a couple of weeks of mince-pie-scoffing and slipper wearing abandon.",

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further \u00a31.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community caf\u00e9. \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community caf\u00e9. Lower Richmond Road Junction \u2013 The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. \u2013 The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension \u2013 The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council\u2019s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: \u201cThe area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.\u201d Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way \u2013 one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre \u2013 which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

Putney Embankment Extension \u2013 The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council\u2019s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: \u201cThe area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.\u201d Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way \u2013 one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre \u2013 which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

Planning documents say: \u201cThe area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.\u201d Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way \u2013 one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre \u2013 which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further \u00a31.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community caf\u00e9. \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further \u00a31.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community caf\u00e9. \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Lower Richmond Road Junction \u2013 The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. \u2013 The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension \u2013 The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council\u2019s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: \u201cThe area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.\u201d Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way \u2013 one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre \u2013 which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

Putney has already seen a number of improvement works since September 2019 and could see some more changes in the future. This week the council announced that it had received a further \u00a31.058m in funding from the Government from the Future High Streets initiative to help increase footfall on the high street. Wandsworth council hopes to split this into three projects which include: The Library Community and Incubator Hub \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library. The plan includes provision of 110sqm of affordable workspace, new meeting rooms and a community caf\u00e9. \u2013 This could see a combined workspace and community hub brought to the high street using the existing library.

Lower Richmond Road Junction \u2013 The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. \u2013 The council wants to give pedestrians more crossing facilities to help them access the northern end of the high street and the Thames. The plan includes a reduction in the number of signalised pedestrian crossing stages and traffic islands to make the pedestrian crossing simpler and easier to navigate. Putney Embankment Extension \u2013 The proposal seeks to extend the Putney Embankment towards the high street and enhance the existing waterfront areas access. It could see a new kiosk building on Lower Richmond Road which combines a bus stop, improved access and coffee shop. The planning document for the future of the Wandle Delta area was also discussed at the council\u2019s planning and transport committee last week (February 4). The Wandle Delta includes a number of sites north of Wandsworth Town Centre and south of the River Thames. Historically, it has been home to a lot of retail warehouses and industrial uses, but the redevelopment will look to increase the residential and leisure areas and provide new areas of public open space. Planning documents say: \u201cThe area will be transformed by creating an accessible and permeable network of streets and spaces, making it easy and enjoyable to get around on foot and by bike and supporting the intensification of uses.\u201d Currently it is home to buildings associated with electricity, the former gas holders, waste and recycling facilities and ongoing access to Thames Tideway infrastructure which make it difficult and confusing to get around. Developers have recently acquired the vacant former gasworks site plus a neighbouring piece of land in Swandon Way \u2013 one of the last remaining undeveloped sites in the town centre \u2013 which the council hopes will be redeveloped to provide more homes and jobs for local people. The two sites cover 1.4 hectares, stretching from the River Wandle in the west up to Swandon Way in the east. It is expected that more sites will come forward for development in the next few years, so it is important for people to comment on the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the area to help provide guidance on what new developments should look like and offer. A public consultation on the redevelopment of the Wandle Delta area will soon take place for residents to share their thoughts and concerns, and it is expected to be adopted in the spring/summer this year.

A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes\u2019 silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance. After servings of pie and peas provided by one of the local pubs, supported by generous donations made by local businesses and residents, guests made their way to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Donations raised locally, paid for the various costs of this event, including the Accrington Pipe Band who lead the Sea Cadets to the Billington and Langho War Memorial. Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard\u2019s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: \"This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.\" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made."

Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard\u2019s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: \"This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.\" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made.",

Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard\u2019s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: \"This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.\" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made.",

Here, they were met by lots of local bystanders who joined in with the service of remembrance led by the Rev. Tracy from St.Leonard\u2019s in Langho. Whalley resident, Neil Martin is among those who attended. He said: \"This was one of the busiest Remembrance Sundays I have witnessed in both Whalley, Billington and Langho for many years. The aim by our local residents is to support the reforming of the Whalley and District Royal British Legion who unfortunately have been unable this year to arrange events locally due to the pandemic and the passing of key members of the RBL branch. This has been helped by support of our local councillors with Ged Mirfin being the lead with them, some remaining members of the RBL in Whalley and some fundraising and physical support by Whalley and District Lions Club.\" Meanwhile, Ribblesdale High School Head Boy Durell and Head Girl Hannah were immensely proud to represent the school at this Sunday's memorial service in Clitheroe. Both pupils found the experience profoundly moving and executed their duties with perfect decorum and respect for all servicemen and women, past and present. All pupils at Ribblesdale spent time last week reflecting on the far-reaching impact of war and terror on not only the servicemen and women themselves, but on all who hold them dear, especially those left behind when the ultimate sacrifice is made.",

A first parade, led by Clitheroe Town Crier Roland Hailwood and Clitheroe Town Band, was followed by a Remembrance Sunday service at Clitheroe Parish Church, conducted by the Rev Andy Froud. A second parade after the church service was to the war memorial where many more residents had gathered to pay their respects. A short service at the war memorial included extracts from For the Fallen and the Kohima epitaph read by Mr Brian Nightingale, the Last Post played by Donna Briggs of Clitheroe Town Band and the two minutes\u2019 silence. Wreaths were laid on behalf of many organisations in Clitheroe. The service at the war memorial was live-streamed by Gregorys Audio Visual on Clitheroe Town Council's Facebook page for those who were unable to attend in person. Residents in Clitheroe pay their respects. Picture by Ken Geddes Services to honour the war heroes were also held in Whalley and Billington. After the church services, people were asked to make their own way to the Whalley War Memorial where a joint service of remembrance was held with the last post sounded at 11am. Later on the Billington and Whalley brass band club was open to welcome guests to the afternoon service of remembrance.

            "doc": "Rishi Sunak departs 10 Downing Street ahead of the weekly Prime Ministers Questions Yes, the new PM had entered number 10 as the Tories\u2019 ratings hit record lows but, despite their public insistence that voters wanted a change of government, cautious opposition MPs feared Sunak just might right his party's ship. Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s reputation as a rather dull political figure had become quite the asset during the brief Truss regime. As she and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng wrought chaos, the boring man suddenly looked like a hugely appealing option. But how would their man play up against a new Prime Minister with a reputation for competence? Where Truss had exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis with her reckless tax-slashing agenda, Sunak was the man who - as Chancellor - had introduced the furlough scheme during the coronavirus pandemic. He might have inherited a party in crisis but there was no denying that Truss\u2019s successor had a track record with some appeal. Starmer\u2019s team recognised this and the Labour leader was at pains to insist colleagues did not allow themselves to get carried away on the basis of the polls. The Prime Minister, he warned them, should not be underestimated. I\u2019m not sure that warning applies any longer. In just three weeks as PM, Sunak has all but destroyed what reputation for decency and competence he might have had. On the day he took over from Truss, Sunak stood outside 10 Downing Street and told us he would lead with compassion. His government, he added, would have \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability at every level\u201d. Since then, it has become abundantly clear that Sunak is a leader who puts self-preservation before all else. The reappointment of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary, six days after she was sacked by Liz Truss for breaching the ministerial code, was more than a clue that this was so. Sunak\u2019s acolytes might have done the rounds of TV and radio studios to explain that Braverman was the best person for the job and that the PM believed in second chances but the truth was that the new Prime Minister had given her the job as the price for her support in the contest to succeed Truss. Sunak did not put Braverman back in cabinet because he thought her appointment best for the country but because it smoothed his path to power. What this appointment also did, however, was reveal an extraordinary weakness. Within hours of his speech about integrity, Sunak had undermined himself. Where was the integrity in appointing a Home Secretary who had, less than a week before, broken the strict rules by which ministers must abide? Of course, the Braverman appointment was not to be the last example of Sunak\u2019s lack of judgement. Despite being warned about allegation of bullying against former chief whip Gavin Williamson, Sunak brought him into his cabinet as minister without portfolio. Troubling details of Williamson\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d soon emerged. Angry messages sent to then Chief Whip Wendy Morton in which he raged about not being invited to the Queen\u2019s funeral became public. This pathetic behaviour was part of a pattern. Last Monday, it was reported that a current minister claimed that - while he was whip - Williamson had issued a \u201ctacit threat\u201d involving her private life while she campaigned on a \u201csensitive issue\u201d. Later the same day, a further report alleged that, during his time as Defence Secretary, Williamson had told an unnamed civic servant to \u201cslit your throat\u201d and \u201cjump out of the window\u201d. And what was Sunak\u2019s response? How did this champion of integrity react to these reports of disturbing behaviour? Why, he expressed his \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Williamson, of course. A day later, Sunak accepted Williamson\u2019s resignation. Sunak\u2019s reckless decision to bring Williamson into government was the equivalent of handing Keir Starmer a bottomless barrel of fish and a blunderbuss. At Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader tore into Sunak over the whole tawdry business. The Prime Minister admitted his regret at appointing Williamson. Those Labour MPs who feared, just three weeks ago, that Sunak might prove problematic for Starmer needn\u2019t, it seems, have worried. In fact, the new Prime Minister has managed to enhance the opposition leader\u2019s standing. As Starmer questioned Sunak on Wednesday, his righteous fury will have chimed with anyone who\u2019s ever had to work with a bully. Sunak has undermined whatever reputation he might have had for propriety and, in doing so, helped shape a new narrative around Starmer. The Labour leader might have struggled for some time under the perception that he was dull and uninspiring. Sunak has turned him into the energetic champion of decency and fair play. The Prime Minister\u2019s woes are far from over. As this weekend arrived, so did new reports suggesting unacceptable behaviour by Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab. When it was announced that Raab had been reappointed at justice, senior civil servants at the ministry were offered \u201crespite or a route out\u201d over fears that some had been traumatised by his past conduct. Sources in the department said Raab had created a culture of fear, that he was demeaning, and that he was a bully. The floodgates are now open when it comes to revelations of this sort. And every new story about ministerial misbehaviour will further erode the idea that the Prime Minister is a man of integrity and good judgement."

Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s reputation as a rather dull political figure had become quite the asset during the brief Truss regime. As she and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng wrought chaos, the boring man suddenly looked like a hugely appealing option. But how would their man play up against a new Prime Minister with a reputation for competence? Where Truss had exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis with her reckless tax-slashing agenda, Sunak was the man who - as Chancellor - had introduced the furlough scheme during the coronavirus pandemic. He might have inherited a party in crisis but there was no denying that Truss\u2019s successor had a track record with some appeal. Starmer\u2019s team recognised this and the Labour leader was at pains to insist colleagues did not allow themselves to get carried away on the basis of the polls. The Prime Minister, he warned them, should not be underestimated. I\u2019m not sure that warning applies any longer. In just three weeks as PM, Sunak has all but destroyed what reputation for decency and competence he might have had. On the day he took over from Truss, Sunak stood outside 10 Downing Street and told us he would lead with compassion. His government, he added, would have \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability at every level\u201d. Since then, it has become abundantly clear that Sunak is a leader who puts self-preservation before all else. The reappointment of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary, six days after she was sacked by Liz Truss for breaching the ministerial code, was more than a clue that this was so. Sunak\u2019s acolytes might have done the rounds of TV and radio studios to explain that Braverman was the best person for the job and that the PM believed in second chances but the truth was that the new Prime Minister had given her the job as the price for her support in the contest to succeed Truss. Sunak did not put Braverman back in cabinet because he thought her appointment best for the country but because it smoothed his path to power. What this appointment also did, however, was reveal an extraordinary weakness. Within hours of his speech about integrity, Sunak had undermined himself. Where was the integrity in appointing a Home Secretary who had, less than a week before, broken the strict rules by which ministers must abide? Of course, the Braverman appointment was not to be the last example of Sunak\u2019s lack of judgement. Despite being warned about allegation of bullying against former chief whip Gavin Williamson, Sunak brought him into his cabinet as minister without portfolio. Troubling details of Williamson\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d soon emerged. Angry messages sent to then Chief Whip Wendy Morton in which he raged about not being invited to the Queen\u2019s funeral became public. This pathetic behaviour was part of a pattern. Last Monday, it was reported that a current minister claimed that - while he was whip - Williamson had issued a \u201ctacit threat\u201d involving her private life while she campaigned on a \u201csensitive issue\u201d. Later the same day, a further report alleged that, during his time as Defence Secretary, Williamson had told an unnamed civic servant to \u201cslit your throat\u201d and \u201cjump out of the window\u201d. And what was Sunak\u2019s response? How did this champion of integrity react to these reports of disturbing behaviour? Why, he expressed his \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Williamson, of course. A day later, Sunak accepted Williamson\u2019s resignation. Sunak\u2019s reckless decision to bring Williamson into government was the equivalent of handing Keir Starmer a bottomless barrel of fish and a blunderbuss.

Sunak\u2019s acolytes might have done the rounds of TV and radio studios to explain that Braverman was the best person for the job and that the PM believed in second chances but the truth was that the new Prime Minister had given her the job as the price for her support in the contest to succeed Truss. Sunak did not put Braverman back in cabinet because he thought her appointment best for the country but because it smoothed his path to power. What this appointment also did, however, was reveal an extraordinary weakness. Within hours of his speech about integrity, Sunak had undermined himself. Where was the integrity in appointing a Home Secretary who had, less than a week before, broken the strict rules by which ministers must abide? Of course, the Braverman appointment was not to be the last example of Sunak\u2019s lack of judgement. Despite being warned about allegation of bullying against former chief whip Gavin Williamson, Sunak brought him into his cabinet as minister without portfolio. Troubling details of Williamson\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d soon emerged. Angry messages sent to then Chief Whip Wendy Morton in which he raged about not being invited to the Queen\u2019s funeral became public. This pathetic behaviour was part of a pattern. Last Monday, it was reported that a current minister claimed that - while he was whip - Williamson had issued a \u201ctacit threat\u201d involving her private life while she campaigned on a \u201csensitive issue\u201d. Later the same day, a further report alleged that, during his time as Defence Secretary, Williamson had told an unnamed civic servant to \u201cslit your throat\u201d and \u201cjump out of the window\u201d. And what was Sunak\u2019s response? How did this champion of integrity react to these reports of disturbing behaviour? Why, he expressed his \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Williamson, of course. A day later, Sunak accepted Williamson\u2019s resignation. Sunak\u2019s reckless decision to bring Williamson into government was the equivalent of handing Keir Starmer a bottomless barrel of fish and a blunderbuss. At Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader tore into Sunak over the whole tawdry business. The Prime Minister admitted his regret at appointing Williamson. Those Labour MPs who feared, just three weeks ago, that Sunak might prove problematic for Starmer needn\u2019t, it seems, have worried. In fact, the new Prime Minister has managed to enhance the opposition leader\u2019s standing. As Starmer questioned Sunak on Wednesday, his righteous fury will have chimed with anyone who\u2019s ever had to work with a bully. Sunak has undermined whatever reputation he might have had for propriety and, in doing so, helped shape a new narrative around Starmer. The Labour leader might have struggled for some time under the perception that he was dull and uninspiring. Sunak has turned him into the energetic champion of decency and fair play. The Prime Minister\u2019s woes are far from over. As this weekend arrived, so did new reports suggesting unacceptable behaviour by Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab. When it was announced that Raab had been reappointed at justice, senior civil servants at the ministry were offered \u201crespite or a route out\u201d over fears that some had been traumatised by his past conduct. Sources in the department said Raab had created a culture of fear, that he was demeaning, and that he was a bully. The floodgates are now open when it comes to revelations of this sort. And every new story about ministerial misbehaviour will further erode the idea that the Prime Minister is a man of integrity and good judgement.",

            "doc": "Contingency plans are being drawn up by UEFA over where to host this season\u2019s Champions League final, the PA news agency understands. The 68,000-capacity Gazprom Arena in St Petersburg had been awarded the chance to host Europe\u2019s showpiece event but events overnight look likely to force a change of venue. Russia president Vladimir Putin instructed an attack on Ukraine with explosions heard in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv while blasts were also reported in the cities of Odessa and Kharkiv. UEFA is monitoring the situation with the Russian city set to be stripped of hosting the final, which is scheduled to take place on May 28. After changing the venue for the final for the 2020 and 2021 editions due to the coronavirus pandemic, European football\u2019s governing body could be forced into a further switch but may wait until the latter stages of the competition to see which sides remain in the tournament. If another all-English final was to occur, like last year\u2019s between Chelsea and Manchester City, there would be pressure to host it in the UK but two major stadiums are already out of bounds. Wembley is set to host the Sky Bet Championship play-off final on May 28 while the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is primed to host rugby league\u2019s Betfred Challenge Cup Final on the same day. It may open the door to another venue in England\u2019s capital, West Ham\u2019s London Stadium, which would have space in its summer schedule, or another UK venue like Cardiff's Principality Stadium which hosted the Champions League final in 2017. London Stadium chief executive Graham Gilmore told The Daily Telegraph: \u201cWe have a great history of putting on world-class events from Major League Baseball to sold-out concerts and of course Premier League matches. \u201cWe are always happy to hear from event holders, and there is a clear track record of the stadium and London hosting the biggest events brilliantly.\u201d Holders Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United are all in the last 16 of the Champions League. Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week told the House of Commons: \u201cA Russia that has pariah status \u2013 no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries.\u201d"

Mr Donaldson said while the comments she faced were \u201cinexcusable\u201d, her anticipated payout stands in stark contrast with the situation faced by many military widows. Ms Murray had worked for the MoD as a civil servant for 19 years, and her religious discrimination case centred upon a series of alleged comments by a captain at Thiepval Barracks during five months in 2017. Bronagh Murray described herself as \u2018a strong, resilient woman\u2019 who \u2018was offered no support\u2019 In one incident he allegedly stated: \u201cI need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help\u201d. In another, while discussing a concert event, he was said to have remarked: \u201cI bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.\u201d Ms Murray also claimed sexual discrimination over being described as \u201cthe big cougar\u201d. Merriam-Webster dictionary describes the slang term \u201ccougar\u201d as meaning \u201c a middle-aged woman seeking a romantic relationship with a younger man\u201d. The captain was disciplined and moved elsewhere as a result. Ms Murray retired in 2019, citing ill health linked to the captain\u2019s behaviour. In a statement, Ms Murray described herself as \u201ca strong, resilient woman\u201d who \u201cwas offered no support and just left to get on with it\u201d. The MoD has admitted liability, and her solicitor Brian Archer said: \u201cIt is anticipated that the final monies to be paid to Ms Murray by the MoD will be in the region of \u00a3560,000.\u201d \u2018SOME GOT \u00a3500 FOR LOSING A PARENT\u2019: IVU spokesman Mr Donaldson told the News Letter: \u201cThe alleged harassment which Ms Murray was awarded compensation for by the MoD was absolutely inexcusable. \u201cThere were undercurrents of sectarian and misogynistic behaviour by the officer concerned. \u201cWe can fully understand and sympathise with Ms Murray\u2019s sense of feeling let down by the very system she had given almost two decades of service to. We wish her well in her recovery as she seeks to rebuild her life. \u201cThis case has however raised serious questions around the level of the settlement granted. \u201cWe have been contacted by many, many families and individuals who feel that the losses they sustained were and continue to be cheapened in comparison. \u201cThere are many instances where the families of soldiers murdered over the course of \u2018The Troubles\u2019 were given compensation in the region of \u00a3500 for a child who had a parent murdered, with a widow or widower receiving \u00a35,000 and less in some situations. \u201cThere are also 270 war widows who had their pensions taken from them by the MoD upon remarrying after their husband was murdered or killed whilst serving. \u201cFor many innocent victims/survivors of terrorism they feel that the injustices they have endured (and continue to endure) have never been adequately acknowledged, nor acceptable reparations or compensation provided.\u201d Asked about the enormous sums involved in the Murray case, NI veterans\u2019 commissioner Danny Kinahan said: \u201cIt is regrettable that this incident ever happened and that a serving officer didn\u2019t uphold the values and standards that are expected of everyone serving in HM Forces today. \u201cI will always stand by that most service personnel and veterans have always upheld the values of the armed forces including courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty and selfless commitment - and have done so professionally and without incident.\u201d The MoD said that the tribunal is not formally a closed case yet, so it cannot comment. The tribunal service said that a written copy of the tribunal\u2019s reasoning will be published at some point, but could not say when. More from this reporter: \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014"

Ms Murray had worked for the MoD as a civil servant for 19 years, and her religious discrimination case centred upon a series of alleged comments by a captain at Thiepval Barracks during five months in 2017. Bronagh Murray described herself as \u2018a strong, resilient woman\u2019 who \u2018was offered no support\u2019 In one incident he allegedly stated: \u201cI need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help\u201d. In another, while discussing a concert event, he was said to have remarked: \u201cI bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.\u201d Ms Murray also claimed sexual discrimination over being described as \u201cthe big cougar\u201d. Merriam-Webster dictionary describes the slang term \u201ccougar\u201d as meaning \u201c a middle-aged woman seeking a romantic relationship with a younger man\u201d. The captain was disciplined and moved elsewhere as a result. Ms Murray retired in 2019, citing ill health linked to the captain\u2019s behaviour. In a statement, Ms Murray described herself as \u201ca strong, resilient woman\u201d who \u201cwas offered no support and just left to get on with it\u201d. The MoD has admitted liability, and her solicitor Brian Archer said: \u201cIt is anticipated that the final monies to be paid to Ms Murray by the MoD will be in the region of \u00a3560,000.\u201d \u2018SOME GOT \u00a3500 FOR LOSING A PARENT\u2019: IVU spokesman Mr Donaldson told the News Letter: \u201cThe alleged harassment which Ms Murray was awarded compensation for by the MoD was absolutely inexcusable. \u201cThere were undercurrents of sectarian and misogynistic behaviour by the officer concerned. \u201cWe can fully understand and sympathise with Ms Murray\u2019s sense of feeling let down by the very system she had given almost two decades of service to. We wish her well in her recovery as she seeks to rebuild her life. \u201cThis case has however raised serious questions around the level of the settlement granted. \u201cWe have been contacted by many, many families and individuals who feel that the losses they sustained were and continue to be cheapened in comparison. \u201cThere are many instances where the families of soldiers murdered over the course of \u2018The Troubles\u2019 were given compensation in the region of \u00a3500 for a child who had a parent murdered, with a widow or widower receiving \u00a35,000 and less in some situations. \u201cThere are also 270 war widows who had their pensions taken from them by the MoD upon remarrying after their husband was murdered or killed whilst serving. \u201cFor many innocent victims/survivors of terrorism they feel that the injustices they have endured (and continue to endure) have never been adequately acknowledged, nor acceptable reparations or compensation provided.\u201d Asked about the enormous sums involved in the Murray case, NI veterans\u2019 commissioner Danny Kinahan said: \u201cIt is regrettable that this incident ever happened and that a serving officer didn\u2019t uphold the values and standards that are expected of everyone serving in HM Forces today. \u201cI will always stand by that most service personnel and veterans have always upheld the values of the armed forces including courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty and selfless commitment - and have done so professionally and without incident.\u201d The MoD said that the tribunal is not formally a closed case yet, so it cannot comment. The tribunal service said that a written copy of the tribunal\u2019s reasoning will be published at some point, but could not say when.

Scores of homes and businesses throughout the town were left without water, or very low pressure, following the burst in Elwick Road. The road is partially closed and temporary traffic lights put in place while engineers work to repair the problem and several shops had to close for the day. Go here for more Hartlepool news and updates from Hartlepool Live The incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning and it was several hours before homeowners saw their water return. A spokesperson for Anglican Water said: \"Following a burst water main on Elwick Road in Hartlepool in the early hours of this morning some customers were affected by loss of water or low pressure. \"We have now isolated the burst and all customers will now have their supply restored and pressure back to normal. \u201cOur teams are onsite repairing the pipe and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.\u201d Christine Hall, owner of Elwick Road Barbers, said she was one of the lucky businesses not affected by the burst, but others in the row were. She said: \"It is strange how it seems to have affected some people and not others. \"Our water pressure was fine, but people on the other side had low pressure.\" The 52-year-old said customers who live in various parts of the town had been in this morning saying their water was affected. She said: \"I had a gent in this morning who lives in Powlett Road and he had no water.\" John Anderson, 81, who lives in the town's Linden Grove said his property was without water first thing this morning. He said: \"When we got up there was no water and then later it started to trickle. We managed this morning, but I couldn't get a shower.\" A member of staff at McColl's in Elwick Road, which was also unaffected, said many people had been into the shop buying bottles of water and they had told her residents in Owton Manor, The Fens and Rift House areas had been affected. On social media sites people said the problems were even felt at far away as The Headland. Shops, including Only Food and Sauces in Owton Manor Lane, posted on Facebook offering for people without water to fill up there and Coun Jonathan Brash, for the Burn Valley ward, urged people to take extra care when in the area of the flood."

Last month, it was revealed that despite schools only being open to the vulnerable children and children of key workers, over a quarter of Lincolnshire primary school kids were attending face-to-face teaching. A third of secondary pupils have returned this week compared to 5 per cent last month. The other two thirds are adopting a phased return to the classroom so they can be tested in a \u201cmanaged way\u201d. Attendance numbers are expected to increase over the next few days. Martin Smith, assistant director for education at the county council, said: \u201cBased on data from Monday (the first day back), early estimates suggest around 95 per cent of primary pupils are now back in school. \u201cIn contrast, many secondary schools have adopted a phased return so pupils can be tested in a managed way. \u201cWe estimate around a third of secondary pupils have already returned and expect to see this increase over the next few days.\u201d This comes as lockdown restrictions loosened for school children on March 8, allowing them to return provided secondary school children take three rapid lateral flow tests for covid-19 and continue to be tested from home twice a week. All pupils in secondary schools have been asked to wear face coverings in class or on school premises with all staff also being tested for coronavirus twice weekly. Parents and staff in primary schools, also have been asked to wear coverings, to minimise the threat of spreading the virus. Are you kids now back at school? Let us know in the comments here Mr Smith also explained that pupils returning to school gates had also seen rapid testing introduced at many schools across the county. He added: \u201cBetween March 5-10, 9,031 lateral flow tests were carried out in schools, of which only 10 were positive. All schools continue to use appropriate safety measures to reduce the potential spread of the virus.\u201d That means just over 0.1 per cent of those involved tested positive. The lockdown in November 2020, saw over 90 per cent of children attending in Lincolnshire as schools were allowed to be open for all pupils, not just for vulnerable and essential workers\u2019 children. At the end of June 2020 after the initial national lockdown, schools adopted a partial return. Almost all primary schools were open to reception, year 1 and year 6 children. However, at that time, only around 35-40 per cent of eligible pupils were attending. Last month, nationally 24 per cent of primary school pupils were on-site during the third lockdown."

Mr Rai was found the following day with two gunshot wounds. Four others have been charged with Mr Rai\u2019s murder and all deny being involved in his death. The layby where Gurinderjit Rai was found dead The trial at Winchester Crown Court previously heard that on the Thursday evening before the murder co-defendants Aston Hannis, Charlie Statham and Paul White had travelled to the area of Hodan\u2019s house. Hannis said that this was to find an area to hide a safe containing drugs. Giving evidence in his case today Hodan said that he saw Hannis\u2019 Audi Q7 drive past his house. He continued: \u201cI was just a bit concerned that his car was in the lane, thinking about what he had come for, so I got in my car and drove up the lane, made out I was going to the shop.\u201d The friends met each other and stopped to talk in their cars, Hodan said: \u201cI said what are you doing back here, and he said he was looking to stash some weed and I said I \u2018don\u2019t f****** do it down my lane, p*** off somewhere else and do it'.\u201d Hodan told the jury that Hannis \u201cmugged it off\u201d telling him not to worry, Hodan added that he did not want that sort of activity near his family home. He later text Hannis saying: \u201cDon\u2019t forgot this time of year the farmers cut the hedges and s**t. Explaining why he sent that text, Hodan said: \u201cThat message was sent to deter them a little bit but in a friendly way.\u201d It is the prosecution\u2019s case that this was sent in reference to the burning of a Mercedes used in Mr Rai\u2019s murder. Hodan denied this. Read more: The friends allege that they had made plans to go to Hodan\u2019s on the night of Mr Rai\u2019s murder to watch Amir Khan\u2019s comeback fight, but the defendant said that White did not arrive until around 11.30pm, and Hannis and Statham around five minutes later, presuming that they had smoked a cigarette outside. Before they arrived Hodan text Hannis: \u201cDon\u2019t leave it too late though people start snooping\u201d and explaining why he said that: \u201cIt was more of a message to say, don\u2019t turn up too late as it p****s my neighbours off. It was more of a message to say that if you\u2019re coming round come now or leave it.\u201d The trio did not arrive until after the boxing had finished, but stayed for around 45 minutes, taking drugs. Hodan\u2019s barrister Nicholas Tucker asked that when the co-defendants arrived \u201cwas there anything about their demeanour or behaviour that caused you concern or alarm\u201d. Hodan replied: \u201cNo, just Aston being Aston, Charlie being Charlie. Don\u2019t know, nothing unusual for me.\u201d The prosecution claim that Hodan used his house as an operational base for serious crime, but he said: \u201cNo, the prosecution are wrong\u201d. Gurinderjit Rai The court heard that Hodan took cannabis and cocaine but did not buy either of these from Hannis\u2019 drug operation. He also denied being involved in the network. Hodan was also asked about a list on Hannis\u2019 phone with his name and denoting that he owed \u00a33,500, but the defendant said that this debt was from an unsuccessful landscaping business that they had launched. Earlier today fellow accused Corin Barlow was asked about two deleted photos from his phone of a person wearing gloves hold gun cartridges and a bag of cartridges. Read next: Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC asked Barlow whether it was him holding the cartridges and why he had these pictures, he replied: \u201cNo, it\u2019s just a friend I sell weed to. I just had em and I just took a picture of em. If I like something I just take a picture of it.\u201d Hannis, 30, of Leah Gardens, Eastleigh; Statham, 30, of Crescent Close, Oliver's Battery; Barlow, 41, from Horley, Surrey; and White, 27, of Dyson Drive, Abbotts Barton, all deny murder. Hodan, 43, denies participating in the criminal activities of an organised crime group. The trial continues."

He continued: \u201cI was just a bit concerned that his car was in the lane, thinking about what he had come for, so I got in my car and drove up the lane, made out I was going to the shop.\u201d The friends met each other and stopped to talk in their cars, Hodan said: \u201cI said what are you doing back here, and he said he was looking to stash some weed and I said I \u2018don\u2019t f****** do it down my lane, p*** off somewhere else and do it'.\u201d Hodan told the jury that Hannis \u201cmugged it off\u201d telling him not to worry, Hodan added that he did not want that sort of activity near his family home. He later text Hannis saying: \u201cDon\u2019t forgot this time of year the farmers cut the hedges and s**t. Explaining why he sent that text, Hodan said: \u201cThat message was sent to deter them a little bit but in a friendly way.\u201d It is the prosecution\u2019s case that this was sent in reference to the burning of a Mercedes used in Mr Rai\u2019s murder. Hodan denied this.

Don\u2019t know, nothing unusual for me.\u201d The prosecution claim that Hodan used his house as an operational base for serious crime, but he said: \u201cNo, the prosecution are wrong\u201d. Gurinderjit Rai The court heard that Hodan took cannabis and cocaine but did not buy either of these from Hannis\u2019 drug operation. He also denied being involved in the network. Hodan was also asked about a list on Hannis\u2019 phone with his name and denoting that he owed \u00a33,500, but the defendant said that this debt was from an unsuccessful landscaping business that they had launched.

Mr Rai was found the following day with two gunshot wounds. Four others have been charged with Mr Rai\u2019s murder and all deny being involved in his death. The layby where Gurinderjit Rai was found dead The trial at Winchester Crown Court previously heard that on the Thursday evening before the murder co-defendants Aston Hannis, Charlie Statham and Paul White had travelled to the area of Hodan\u2019s house. Hannis said that this was to find an area to hide a safe containing drugs. Giving evidence in his case today Hodan said that he saw Hannis\u2019 Audi Q7 drive past his house. He continued: \u201cI was just a bit concerned that his car was in the lane, thinking about what he had come for, so I got in my car and drove up the lane, made out I was going to the shop.\u201d The friends met each other and stopped to talk in their cars, Hodan said: \u201cI said what are you doing back here, and he said he was looking to stash some weed and I said I \u2018don\u2019t f****** do it down my lane, p*** off somewhere else and do it'.\u201d Hodan told the jury that Hannis \u201cmugged it off\u201d telling him not to worry, Hodan added that he did not want that sort of activity near his family home. He later text Hannis saying: \u201cDon\u2019t forgot this time of year the farmers cut the hedges and s**t. Explaining why he sent that text, Hodan said: \u201cThat message was sent to deter them a little bit but in a friendly way.\u201d It is the prosecution\u2019s case that this was sent in reference to the burning of a Mercedes used in Mr Rai\u2019s murder. Hodan denied this. Read more: The friends allege that they had made plans to go to Hodan\u2019s on the night of Mr Rai\u2019s murder to watch Amir Khan\u2019s comeback fight, but the defendant said that White did not arrive until around 11.30pm, and Hannis and Statham around five minutes later, presuming that they had smoked a cigarette outside. Before they arrived Hodan text Hannis: \u201cDon\u2019t leave it too late though people start snooping\u201d and explaining why he said that: \u201cIt was more of a message to say, don\u2019t turn up too late as it p****s my neighbours off. It was more of a message to say that if you\u2019re coming round come now or leave it.\u201d The trio did not arrive until after the boxing had finished, but stayed for around 45 minutes, taking drugs. Hodan\u2019s barrister Nicholas Tucker asked that when the co-defendants arrived \u201cwas there anything about their demeanour or behaviour that caused you concern or alarm\u201d. Hodan replied: \u201cNo, just Aston being Aston, Charlie being Charlie. Don\u2019t know, nothing unusual for me.\u201d The prosecution claim that Hodan used his house as an operational base for serious crime, but he said: \u201cNo, the prosecution are wrong\u201d. Gurinderjit Rai The court heard that Hodan took cannabis and cocaine but did not buy either of these from Hannis\u2019 drug operation. He also denied being involved in the network. Hodan was also asked about a list on Hannis\u2019 phone with his name and denoting that he owed \u00a33,500, but the defendant said that this debt was from an unsuccessful landscaping business that they had launched. Earlier today fellow accused Corin Barlow was asked about two deleted photos from his phone of a person wearing gloves hold gun cartridges and a bag of cartridges. Read next: Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC asked Barlow whether it was him holding the cartridges and why he had these pictures, he replied: \u201cNo, it\u2019s just a friend I sell weed to. I just had em and I just took a picture of em. If I like something I just take a picture of it.\u201d Hannis, 30, of Leah Gardens, Eastleigh; Statham, 30, of Crescent Close, Oliver's Battery; Barlow, 41, from Horley, Surrey; and White, 27, of Dyson Drive, Abbotts Barton, all deny murder. Hodan, 43, denies participating in the criminal activities of an organised crime group. The trial continues.",

The band under Adam Bonniface provided a well controlled and balanced accompaniment for the musical numbers, avoiding the much heard criticism of drowning out the singers (I heard every word). The story follows the life of Arthur Kipps (Alex Wright) and his childhood sweetheart Anne Pornick (Lizzie Wlodarczyk) as they navigate their way through life, love and the class system of the early 1900s. Alex gave a wonderful performance as he manoeuvred through the highs and lows of Arthur\u2019s life and loves. David Kirk as the theatrical Chitterlow was suitably eccentric and full of life whilst never threatening to overshadow the lead characters. When poor shop assistant Arthur comes into money separates him from his old life and suddenly moves him into the higher classes where he feels an outsider. He\u2019s never really abandoned by his old friends and they help him realise what he has left behind and he fights to get it back. The set was the perfect backdrop, drawing together the story from opening to closing scene. Brilliantly inventive whilst allowing plenty of room for the full cast production numbers. This was a true ensemble piece with too many wonderful performances to mention all individually, but they fit together perfectly like a 1000 piece jigsaw. The scenes were full of comedy, pathos and social commentary, I especially enjoyed the sculpture scene which was full of inventive fun. Some of the old musical numbers are still there, although with slight changes to lyrics, whilst the new ones add to the story. The production was one that deserved full houses, and more performances, but in this post covid climate it seems people are still reluctant to venture to the theatre in the numbers they once did. It is a shame as amateur groups such as Yeadon deserve our full support. They are the life blood of theatre often giving young people their first taste of the joy it bring both performing and watching. Shows like this provide precious memories for old and young alike, thank you Yeadon Theatre Company for providing yet another outstanding production, I look forward to many more to come.

AI facial recognition technology was used on over 300,000 instagram pictures that were posted with hashtags that related to having bought a new home such as #homeowner, #firsttimehomebuyer, and #newhome. The technology determined the emotions felt by the face or faces in the picture and give a score to each emotion, the highest scoring emotion was then determined to be the dominant one. AI facial recognition software is able to pick up anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The study was conducted throughout the UK and Derry came out second overall, behind Blackpool, with new home-owners reportedly 70% happier than the UK average. Belfast came second in the north and Carickfergus came second, with happiness scores of 40% and 31% respectively, while Hollywood came in last in the north, with a happiness score of 52% below the national average.",

Jessica Buckle, 35, of north Hull says daughter Maddison was sent into isolation at Sirius Academy North on Tuesday, November 3, - as a punishment for her school trousers - which she has worn for several weeks - not having a button at the front. After phoning home upset, Miss Buckle told her daughter not to go into isolation, and instead to come home before lunch, which led to the school excluding her for the afternoon. The school referred to \"defiance and truancy\" as the reason in a letter which was hand delivered that evening. Ms Buckle says Maddison has worn the very same trousers since the start of the school year in September, and does not understand why they were suddenly a problem after the half term break, as she accused teachers at the Hall Road secondary school of running a \"military school\". \"Today they excluded my daughter from school for having a button on her trousers,\" She said.

They class them as leggings but they are not tight. \"They also had a problem with her black shoes because they had a frill on the front, that wasn\u2019t acceptable, they had to be plain black. \"Then I get a threatening letter stating she was truant from school so I could face a fine and parent order through court yet in this same letter they said they excluded her the same day. \"So she hasn't been truanting. The letter states that they excluded her, so how she can she be truant when they excluded her?\" The letter, seen by Hull Live said Ms Buckle had a \"duty\" to ensure Maddison was not present in a public place within the Academy during the exclusion afternoon, and warns of a fine from the local authority if Maddison entered the Academy during the specified time. The mum of five said her daughter always looks smart, with a shirt, tie and blazer, and claims the teachers should be concentrating on their pupils' education, instead of \"obsessing\" over what they wear. (Image: Jessica Buckley / Hull Live) She added: \"I completely understand they need to be in correct uniform but buttons and shoes, next it will be underwear. \"They say uniform affects their education, rubbish, putting them in isolation or exclusion is affecting their education and they have really picked on the wrong mother with this. \"Why do you need to look at where the button is? No way is what she\u2019s wearing affecting her education. \"It\u2019s the principle of the matter, the school is coming down way to hard, penalising the kids for some of the most ridiculous things. \"They need to give parents a break and teachers need to do their jobs of teaching and not act like it\u2019s a military school. \"It's lunacy in my opinion.\" It's not the first time Maddison has found herself in isolation, over things Ms Buckle claims are \"trivial\", and she now says she feels her daughter is being targeted by the teachers, with the problem over the trousers the \"last straw.\" Ms Buckle said Maddison was never in trouble in Year Seven and Eight, but after starting back at school after lockdown in Year Nine in September, there had been \"one thing after another.\" She added: \"I'm sick to my back teeth of that school. \"They target and bully her using ridiculous excuses as to why she's in isolation even though she's in top sets and never had any issues before. \"I sent my daughter in a beautiful school dress, it was black and knee length an couldn't be pulled up, with a shirt, tie and blazer, but a teacher put their hands on the skirt and attempted to pull said skirt down to prove a point that it should be below the knee. \"Obviously I was furious because if this wasn't a school dress it could well have been pulled down an caused major embarrassment. \"She then got put in isolation because she took her face mask off at the exit and was told to put it back on and she said 'I'm leaving the building, I'm at the exit', so the teacher said 'either come back in and put your mask on or you will be put in isolation.' So she put her mask on and the teacher said 'You\u2019re in isolation anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter.' \"I have had enough, it's every day for isolation for one thing or another and she's not a bad kid at all, she's a lovely girl who tries hard but I just feel enough is enough now.\" After the alleged incident with the dress, Ms Buckle along and Maddison's stepdad had a meeting with the school, where Ms Buckle claims she was reassured no teacher would \"touch\" her daughter again. She said she agreed to give the school \"the benefit of the doubt\", but just two days into the new term Maddison found herself in isolation again. She added: \"For whatever reason since lockdown it's like they\u2019ve gone all out in regards to uniform. \"It\u2019s one thing after another. It\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s awful, you worry about kids bullying her, but not the teachers. \"She goes to school anxious, not knowing what she will get into trouble for next.\" Find the latest news in your area Ms Buckle said she is now considering pulling her daughter out of the school and home-schooling her instead. She added: \"When I got the letter I was shocked, I did take it as a direct threat from the school that they are going to be taking me to court, all because of a pair of trousers, I can't believe they\u2019re pulling these tricks, I was disgusted and appalled they were making the threats. \"We had a phone call last night and they said 'you should let us check it [the uniform] off', I said 'are you joking me? This is not your child, this is my child, as long as she has black trousers and a shirt, tie and blazer, I don\u2019t think its any of your business me bringing their clothes in to check.' \"I\u2019ve kept her off today [Wednesday], I'm considering pulling her out and putting her into temporary home education until I find something more suitable, or the school pull their socks up a bit and realise they\u2019re not running a military school.\" What the school says A spokesperson for the school said: \"We cannot comment on individual cases, however we do discuss individual concerns with parents and we have done that in this case. \"We will listen to parents and if they have any concerns we will talk to them and we will do everything we can to resolve them.\u201d"

Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by garda\u00ed in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: \"Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. \"We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate.\" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at \u20ac179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just \u20ac20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an \"opportunistic and devious way\". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: \"What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people.\" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only \u20ac20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of \u20ac3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a \"significant level of premeditation\" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years."

However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: \"Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. \"We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate.\" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at \u20ac179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just \u20ac20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an \"opportunistic and devious way\". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: \"What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people.\" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only \u20ac20,000. A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of \u20ac3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a \"significant level of premeditation\" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",

A cheque for Conor O'Loughlin in the sum of \u20ac3,150 was in court for him as part of what he was entitled to from the sale of the house. Barrister for Ms O'Loughlin, Mr Shane Costello, said that his client was very sorry for the hurt she had caused Conor and said his client was suffering from psychological and alcohol-related issues. Judge John Aylmer said there was a \"significant level of premeditation\" in what Ms O'Loughlin, of Greeve Park, Strabane, Co Tyrone, had done which helped her benefit. He said he placed it in the mid-range of such offences and merited a sentence of four years in prison before mitigation. He added she had entered an early plea, had no previous convictions and claimed she could not recall getting a divorce. He reduced the sentence to one of three years and said he was going to suspend the sentence on condition that Ms O'Loughlin enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for three years.",

Carer Bernadette O'Loughlin appeared at Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal where she pleaded guilty to using a form to get letters of administration to Keith O'Loughlin's estate. Mr O'Loughlin had died in 2006 and he had left a house in Findrum, Convoy. The 56-year-old accused had divorced Mr O'Loughlin in Northern Ireland in 2002. However, when interviewed by garda\u00ed in Letterkenny in September 2019, she claimed she had no memory of getting a divorce. She added that she did not think any such divorce would have any impact on any matters in the Republic of Ireland. Detective Garda Peter Cullen gave evidence in the case and told how the couple had two children together. However, after they divorced, Mr O'Loughlin met another woman, remarried and they had a son Conor O'Loughlin. Det Cullen said: \"Bernadette O'Loughlin made an application in Letterkenny for letters of administration by submitting documents holding herself out to be the legal wife although she was actually divorced at the time. \"We got a statement from the probate office that if they had been made aware of the divorce outside Ireland, the matter would have had to be referred to the court for all parties. His three lawful children would have been entitled to his estate.\" The house left in the estate of Keith O'Loughlin, who died aged 39 years, was valued at \u20ac179,000 in 2009 but had depreciated greatly and sold in 2017 for just \u20ac20,000. Ms O'Loughlin claimed for two thirds of the estate and his three children got a ninth each. Conor O'Loughlin's mother Karen, who married Mr O'Loughlin, told how the issue had impacted her son greatly. She said it was used in an \"opportunistic and devious way\". Student Conor O'Loughlin, who was just four when his father had died, said he was angry at the manner in which his father's first wife was allowed to carry out what she did. He told the court: \"What was rightly mine was taken away from me so cruelly. I'm angry this was allowed to happen to me by professional people.\" The court heard the house when sold was in a dilapidated state and fetched only \u20ac20,000.
