"James Sinclair, 31, of Three Colt Street, Limehouse will serve at least 41 years in prison for the two unprovoked attacks on lone strangers after being sentenced today - Friday, July 8.

He was found guilty of the murder of Shadika Patel, 40, and the attempted murder of a 48-year-old woman on July 5 following a trial at the Old Bailey.

Sinclair was given a life sentence, with a minimum term of 41 years, for the murder and another life sentence, with at least 18 years’ imprisonment, for the attempted murder.

The two sentences will be served at the same time and the 830 days he spent on remand in custody will be taken off the total.

Det Ch Insp Mark Rogers, speaking after the sentencing hearing, said: ""I am pleased with the length of the prison sentence, which reflects the severity of James Sinclair’s crimes.

""James Sinclair will now spend the majority of the rest of his life in prison and will no longer pose a threat to anyone on the streets of London.""

The jury heard Shadika was stabbed repeatedly by Sinclair in Altmore Avenue, East Ham in the early hours of March 19, 2020.

She was taking a food parcel to her two teenage sons in the lead up to the first national coronavirus lockdown at the time, the Old Bailey heard.

The next day, Sinclair attacked the other woman in Belfont Walk, Holloway, leaving her with a number of serious injuries that required hospital treatment including a punctured lung.

Sinclair was arrested on 27 March after police released CCTV footage which showed him after the murder of Shadika.

He had pleaded not guilty to the charges of murder and attempted murder, refused to attend court during his trial and never gave an explanation for why he attacked the two women.

Det Insp John Marriott, the lead investigator, said: ""James Sinclair’s actions have devastated the lives of Shadika’s friends and family and left her two teenage sons without a mother.

""It is incomprehensible why he chose to attack two lone women at night.

"Kaya Colakoglu went into the shop on Westminster Road at around 8.30pm on Saturday, January 2 carrying a large knife.

He went straight behind the counter and demanded that an employee, who was serving a customer, open the till.

After pointing the knife towards the store worker and threatening to stab him, Colakoglu opened the till himself.

He then stole the cash that was inside it and fled on foot.

Colakoglu was wearing a surgical face mask during the armed robbery, but he took it off before buying a bottle of rum and a soft drink at a convenience store on the nearby Stanley Road soon afterwards.

Detectives investigating the robbery released CCTV images of the unmasked Colakoglu and information provided by members of the public subsequently led to him being swiftly identified as the offender.

He was arrested at his home in Lime Street, Ellesmere Port, just 17-and-a-half hours after committing the knifepoint robbery.

Colakoglu immediately admitted to being the armed robber, stating that he was ‘mortified’ by what he had done.

He was subsequently charged with robbery and possession of a knife in a public place.

Colakoglu pleaded guilty to both offences and was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Monday, February 1.

He was jailed for 40 months and ordered to pay a £190 victim surcharge.

The offending also triggered a 10-month suspended prison sentence imposed on Colakoglu by Mold Crown Court on Wednesday, August 12.

That sentence was for assault, affray, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place offences that Colakoglu committed in Rhyl, North Wales, earlier in 2020.

As such, the total sentence Colakoglu now has to serve is 50 months in prison.

Detective Constable Steve Popplestone, who led the investigation into the robbery at Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: “The man who was working behind the counter at the convenience store on Westminster Road was subjected to a terrifying ordeal that understandably left him extremely shaken up.

“The incident was also frightening for the man who was being served by the store worker at the time of the armed robbery.

“Thankfully – through CCTV footage, an appeal we issued to the local media and information that was subsequently provided by members of the public – we were able to quickly establish that Kaya Colakoglu was responsible for the robbery and arrest him.

“I hope the fact that he is now behind bars facing the consequences of his actions brings some closure to the store worker he threatened at knifepoint.

“I also hope that this case acts as a deterrent to other people and stops them from committing such crimes.”

Chief Inspector Sarah Heath, Cheshire Constabulary’s knife crime lead, added: “We are committed to doing all we can to tackle knife crime.

“We will respond robustly to any knife related incidents and do all we can to ensure that anyone found to be carrying a knife or committing a knife related offence is brought to justice.

“Members of the public have a vital role to play in our fight against knife crime by giving us information about crimes involving knives and those who carry weapons.

"Kaya Colakoglu went into the shop on Westminster Road at around 8.30pm on Saturday, January 2 carrying a large knife.

He went straight behind the counter and demanded that an employee, who was serving a customer, open the till.

After pointing the knife towards the store worker and threatening to stab him, Colakoglu opened the till himself.

He then stole the cash that was inside it and fled on foot.

Colakoglu was wearing a surgical face mask during the armed robbery, but he took it off before buying a bottle of rum and a soft drink at a convenience store on the nearby Stanley Road soon afterwards.

Detectives investigating the robbery released CCTV images of the unmasked Colakoglu and information provided by members of the public subsequently led to him being swiftly identified as the offender.

He was arrested at his home in Lime Street, Ellesmere Port, just 17-and-a-half hours after committing the knifepoint robbery.

Colakoglu immediately admitted to being the armed robber, stating that he was ‘mortified’ by what he had done.

He was subsequently charged with robbery and possession of a knife in a public place.

Colakoglu pleaded guilty to both offences and was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Monday, February 1.

He was jailed for 40 months and ordered to pay a £190 victim surcharge.

The offending also triggered a 10-month suspended prison sentence imposed on Colakoglu by Mold Crown Court on Wednesday, August 12.

That sentence was for assault, affray, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place offences that Colakoglu committed in Rhyl, North Wales, earlier in 2020.

As such, the total sentence Colakoglu now has to serve is 50 months in prison.

Detective Constable Steve Popplestone, who led the investigation into the robbery at Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: “The man who was working behind the counter at the convenience store on Westminster Road was subjected to a terrifying ordeal that understandably left him extremely shaken up.

“The incident was also frightening for the man who was being served by the store worker at the time of the armed robbery.

“Thankfully – through CCTV footage, an appeal we issued to the local media and information that was subsequently provided by members of the public – we were able to quickly establish that Kaya Colakoglu was responsible for the robbery and arrest him.

“I hope the fact that he is now behind bars facing the consequences of his actions brings some closure to the store worker he threatened at knifepoint.

“I also hope that this case acts as a deterrent to other people and stops them from committing such crimes.”

Chief Inspector Sarah Heath, Cheshire Constabulary’s knife crime lead, added: “We are committed to doing all we can to tackle knife crime.

“We will respond robustly to any knife related incidents and do all we can to ensure that anyone found to be carrying a knife or committing a knife related offence is brought to justice.

“Members of the public have a vital role to play in our fight against knife crime by giving us information about crimes involving knives and those who carry weapons.

"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

Read more: Detective welcomes jailing of ""heartless"" County Durham fraudster

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

"Kirsty Sheldon, now 46, of Defoe Crescent, Newton Aycliffe, was sentenced to a total 32-months’ imprisonment at Durham Crown Court in March.

It followed her guilty pleas to possessing criminal property, despite disputing the amount involved, and fraud.

The court heard the money laundering charge related to funds loaned to her in 2017 to help set up a clothing supply business, My Couture Heaven, in Newton Aycliffe.

She was said to have been loaned various sums, amounting to £98,725, by an associate of a business partner, from Dundee, in Scotland.

Sheldon repeatedly made excuses why she could not pay the money back, as promised, only, eventually, repaying £8,002 of the amount received.

During a trial of issue staged at the court, prior to her being sentenced, she claimed she only received about £12,000 in loans, but Judge James Adkin found against her and accused her of telling “clear lies” in fobbing off the lender, knowing full well that she was unable to repay the money.

The fraud case related to the online sale of static caravan holidays at the Haggerston Castle site, in north Northumberland, in 2017 and 2018.

Although some of her customers went on to have satisfactory breaks, some turned up having travelled to the site, near Berwick, only to discover the holiday home they had booked to stay in was already occupied, or the booking did not exist.

Some had to pay to stay in alternative accommodation and were not compensated by Sheldon.

As with the money laundering charge, she gave a variety of excuses to holidaymakers she had let down and left out of pocket.

The court heard that the resulting 32-month sentence she is now serving is not her first jail stretch, as, in 2014, when known as Kirsty Cox, she received a two-year sentence at Teesside Crown Court for the fraudulent sale of iPad computers at knock-down prices.

While some devices were sold, she was unable to keep up with demand, despite taking customers’ money up front, leaving 40 out of pocket by more than £450,000.

She subsequently failed to meet the crime proceeds settlement figure agreed in that case.

In the latest case, it was estimated that with interest she benefited by £114,438.46 from her criminal activities, but the available amount to confiscate from her is only £200.

Judge Adkin, therefore, ordered that the £200 be paid by way of compensation, to be divided between her victims.

Although she is serving her sentence in Low Newton Women’s Prison, she was given 28 days to pay the £200 or risk receiving an extra 28 days behind bars, in default.

"LIMAVADY United's unbeaten run in the league this year comes to an end with a 1-0 defeat to Bangor who take the top spot of the table.

Lewis Harrison slotted one into the bottom corner in the 23rd minute in what proved to be the only goal of the game.

The same player had a chance to double his tally but was unlucky when his effort hit of the upright just before half-time.

Limavady Utd manager Andy Law admitted it was always going to be a tough game against the league leaders.

“Going into the game we hadn't played Bangor this season so it was always going to be a nervy affair with both teams in the top six,” said Andy.

"A county council officer has been criticised by a city council leader after he refused to take part in a meeting if the media was present.

The virtual meeting was set up to explain why roads in Ripon were in poor state of repair.

Karl Battersby, Corporate Director, Business and Environmental Services at North Yorkshire County Council said he was “not prepared to have the discussion with the media present.”

The issue of the roads around the city of Ripon is one that many members of the public have complained about. The Independent run City Council has made many representations to the Conservative run County Council over the matter.

It’s been pointed out that while some laybys in Wensleydale have been resurfaced there are still potholes in the centre of town. It’s also been made clear that the Highway Maintenance Government Grant has been cut by £4m, which is not helping.

[tptn_list limit=3 daily=1 hour_range=1]

Council Leader Andrew Williams had written to Mr Battersby requesting that either he or the Cabinet Member or indeed both attend a meeting of Ripon City Council which, said Cllr Williams, is a public meeting and open to scrutiny by everyone.

He said it was agreed it could be a virtual meeting but that should be open to the media to watch. Cllr Williams said he thought that the public needed to hear the explanations of NYCC on this matter.

Mr Battersby said he did not want the media in attendance saying it was a discussion between “ourselves” and not a public meeting.

Cllr Williams told YorkMix that Mr Battersby asked that the meeting could be done over the internet as many meetings have been done since covid. But the law prevents formal council meetings being done online now so this had to be an informal meeting.

“We still wanted the media to be present as they would be if the meeting was held in person at the council.

“The Director refuseds to allow you (media) access despite my best efforts. He wishes to remain in his ivory tower and avoid public scrutiny which I think is unacceptable.”

Update

The meeting went ahead without the media and Cllr Andrew Williams Leader Ripon City Council, issued a statement saying: “I am confused as to why NYCC were not prepared to admit the press into the meeting as it was constructive and cordial.

“We discussed a number of roads which are of concern to local residents and have made some limited progress.

“The situation has not been helped by a central government which claims to have a levelling up agenda for the north but has reduced this year the highway maintenance grant by £4m, not levelling up at all in reality.”",ID_7,Ripon,North Yorkshire,York,yorkmix.com,article-110188

"MERIDEN MP, Saqib Bhatti grabbed a litter picker and a bag and helped community groups to Keep Meriden Tidy.

The Conservative MP started his weekend clean up in Marston Green where Saqib met councillors Bob and Gail Sleigh along with members of the newly formed Marston Green Wombles, where they were welcomed afterwards at the Picnic Basket for a hot drink.

He then headed to Babbs Mill Park to meet with Clean and Green Solihull and the Mayor of the West Midlands who was running his West Midlands Great Clean Up ahead of the Commonwealth Games.

The next day he started in Balsall Common before heading off to then ventured to Castle Bromwich to meet with the Castle Bromwich Litter Pickers where they picked up six bags of litter.





He ended the campaign with Dorridge U3A and other local residents with the help of the Knowle and Dorridge Lions in Dorridge Park where volunteers found litter ranging from crisp packets to parts of a washing machine.

Mr Bhatti said: “I was thrilled to host another Keep Meriden Tidy weekend and help local groups in their endeavour to keep Meriden tidy.

“The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have exacerbated problems such as littering and fly-tipping.

“However, getting back on track after the pandemic will involve tackling this issue.

“£1billion is spent on picking up litter from our public places every year.

“With the help of local litter picking groups, the impact of this is lower but we still have a huge problem when it comes to littering.

"Merchiston Surgery put out an open letter to patients after a rise in the number of threats and abuse faced by its health workers.

GP practices in the region have seen a spike in activity in the space of 12 months, with 388,391 primary care appointments being carried out last month in Swindon, Wiltshire, Bath and North East Somerset, an increase of 73 per cent compared to the previous year.

A spokesperson for the surgery on Highworth Road, Stratton St Margaret told the Adver: “This is unacceptable, we have always had a zero-tolerance policy towards abuse of all kinds and pre-Covid had cause to give written warnings to some patients.

“However, there has been a significant increase in the verbal abuse that our staff are experiencing from some patients since the beginning of lockdown easing. There have also been recent instances when patients have caused physical damage to our property.”

“Receptionists are regularly being threatened verbally by patients, which is distressing for all staff working at Merchiston Surgery. This reflects what is happening in many areas of the country.”

Those incidents have directly affected the workers’ mental health and resilience. The spokesperson said: “At a time when the NHS is experiencing unprecedented demand for appointments in primary care and our staff are delivering Covid vaccinations at Steam – often on their days off or after their usual shift – this added pressure is unfair to staff who have worked throughout the pandemic and do their absolute best every day to help patients.

“Thank you for those patients who have sent us messages and letters of support – we appreciate them so much.”

In the letter sent to patients and published on its website, the surgery said in extreme circumstances patients abusing staff may be removed from its patient list.

It read: “You may be aware from press and social media reports that there is increased demand for appointments nationally and at Merchiston we are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of requests for GP and nursing appointments.

“As we are still in the Covid pandemic, the NHS recommends that we triage or phone back every patient who wants advice from a nurse, doctor or other healthcare professional.”

The surgery cannot offer GP appointments to book in advance. “These appointments are for routine matters and acute problems and are bookable same day in the morning from 8am and in the afternoon from 12. Clinic days and times vary for individual GPs and may change from week to week.

“We also have a daily triage GP available to deal with clinically urgent same day requests from patients. This GP decides what and when treatment is appropriate.”

Dr Andrew Girdher, clinical chair of Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Clinical Commissioning Group said: “It is very concerning to hear of this behaviour, especially given that practice staff have played such a vital role in ensuring everyday health and care was able to continue in a Covid-safe way throughout the pandemic, while at the same time being the absolute driving force behind the extensive rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.

“My colleagues, like others in the NHS, do all they can to provide high quality care on a daily basis and, while we recognise the last year has been very difficult for everyone and that some may feel frustration at being asked to wait for an appointment as teams prioritise those most in need, threatening or abusive behaviour is never acceptable.”

The officer, who is based at Worcester Police Station, has been suspended from his role.

The 54-year-old is accused of raping and sexually assaulting a woman in November 2018 and is also charged with further sexual assaults in August last year.

The first count, of sexual assault by touching, is said to have happened on November 18, 2018.

The following two charges of sexual assault are alleged to have happened on November 9 that year.

He is also accused of raping a woman on the same day.

The remaining counts are both alleged to have happened on August 29 last year and relate to sexual assault by touching.

The alleged offences took place in the Worcestershire and Coventry areas.

Judge James Burbidge ruled Darbyshire’s address could be withheld from the public after the defence made an application to exclude it, saying he had been threatened previously, when individuals followed him in their car making cut-throat gestures and telling him he was dead.

The judge agreed to the application but said the press would have the chance to challenge it.

He told Darbyshire: “You have denied responsibility and a jury will try you on March 25.

“If you are in-fact guilty, you should admit it as the judge will discount the sentence.”

Darbyshire was granted bail at the end of the hearing, but is barred from entering Fernhill Heath or the White Hart pub.",ID_49,Worcester Crown Court,Worcester,Wyre Forest,kidderminstershuttle.co.uk,article-1188464

The 54-year-old is accused of raping and sexually assaulting a woman in November 2018 and is also charged with further sexual assaults in August last year.

The first count, of sexual assault by touching, is said to have happened on November 18, 2018.

The following two charges of sexual assault are alleged to have happened on November 9 that year.

He is also accused of raping a woman on the same day.

The remaining counts are both alleged to have happened on August 29 last year and relate to sexual assault by touching.

The alleged offences took place in the Worcestershire and Coventry areas.

Judge James Burbidge ruled Darbyshire’s address could be withheld from the public after the defence made an application to exclude it, saying he had been threatened previously, when individuals followed him in their car making cut-throat gestures and telling him he was dead.

The judge agreed to the application but said the press would have the chance to challenge it.

He told Darbyshire: “You have denied responsibility and a jury will try you on March 25.

“If you are in-fact guilty, you should admit it as the judge will discount the sentence.”

"More than 5,000 swimmers from across the country are expected at Brockhole this weekend for the Great North Swim, which takes place over three days from Friday, June 10 to Sunday, June 12.

The event caters for all ages and abilities across a variety of distances - from 250m to a marathon 10K open water challenge.

Sue Radford, the mum of Britain’s biggest family, will be taking part in a one-mile swim, today, alongside a TV crew filming for her show 22 Kids and Counting.

Held in the stunning surroundings of the Lake District National Park, the Great North Swim is a great day out and the popular event village at Brockhole will include a big screen to watch all the action, exhibitor stands, pop-up food stalls, music, and a bar.

As well as a BBQ at the Garden Shed, a vintage fish and chip van, the Yardies Jamaican street food, Super8 Pizza, and Earthword Kitchen, the beer tent in the main spectator area will be serving a selection of local Lakes beers and celebratory prosecco.

Despite preparations being well underway organisers have issued a warning that adverse weather conditions could have an effect on the event this weekend and have already taken the difficult decision to cancel the Great North SwimRun, scheduled for Saturday.

Event Director, Colin Murphy, said: “The weather forecast for this weekend shows some challenging conditions, with strong winds across Windermere that could result in some choppy water.

“As always, the safety and wellbeing of participants is our number one priority, and if the conditions or forecast worsens, we may need to make changes to the timetable.

“We have taken the difficult decision to cancel the SwimRun given the complexity and challenging nature of the event but at present the swim-only programme will go ahead as planned.

“We will continue to monitor the situation and communicate any changes via text, email and social media if we need to, so please stay connected ahead of your swim.”

"Nicola Milner, from Llysfaen, was awarded the “Worshipful Livery Company of Wales Literacy Award” for achieving the grades needed for university whilst battling with dyslexia.

Her tutor, Holly, nominated her for the award.

She originally studied GCSEs in Maths and English - at the college’s Rhos-on-Sea and Abergele campuses respectively - before gaining a place on the Access to Higher Education (HE) - Health course at Rhos.

She is now studying adult nursing at Bangor University, which she started last September.

Before her college studies, Nicola previously worked as a carer in the community for several years.

But she had always wanted to go into the adult nursing field, so sat the required GCSEs before enrolling on the Access to HE course.

Nicola has dyslexia, which made the literacy side of the course very difficult, so she had to work twice as hard.

Not happy with just passing her units, she got distinctions across the board.

Nicola said: “I couldn’t believe it when I was told that I had won the award; I didn’t even know that Holly had entered me!

“I will use the money to buy a much-needed printer to help with my university course.

“There are so many apps now to aid dyslexics, and the university has been brilliant, even supplying me with a Dictaphone.

“I had an amazing time at college. Both my tutors and my classmates were so supportive. I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support.”

Nicola would eventually like a career as a practitioner/prescriber.

Tutor Holly Maxwell said: “We are really proud of Nicola’s achievements. She got the grades she deserved whilst at college. Considering the circumstances, this is an extremely impressive feat.”

Founded in 1993, the Worshipful Livery Company of Wales (WLCOW) promotes education, the arts, science and technology in Wales.

It is dedicated to helping young people to develop their talents and skills by means of an annual awards programme of scholarships and bursaries to students in schools, universities and technical colleges across Wales, as well as to apprentices and young people in the armed forces.

The Access to Higher Education programme is a passport to university-level study and has been provided by Coleg Llandrillo for nearly 30 years.

It is a flexible programme which is designed for adults who have few, if any, school qualifications, but who wish to prepare for university-level study.

College's student union named best in Wales for fourth consecutive time

Tutor Holly Maxwell said: “We are really proud of Nicola’s achievements. She got the grades she deserved whilst at college. Considering the circumstances, this is an extremely impressive feat.”

Founded in 1993, the Worshipful Livery Company of Wales (WLCOW) promotes education, the arts, science and technology in Wales.

It is dedicated to helping young people to develop their talents and skills by means of an annual awards programme of scholarships and bursaries to students in schools, universities and technical colleges across Wales, as well as to apprentices and young people in the armed forces.

The Access to Higher Education programme is a passport to university-level study and has been provided by Coleg Llandrillo for nearly 30 years.

It is a flexible programme which is designed for adults who have few, if any, school qualifications, but who wish to prepare for university-level study.

"Nicola Milner, from Llysfaen, was awarded the “Worshipful Livery Company of Wales Literacy Award” for achieving the grades needed for university whilst battling with dyslexia.

Her tutor, Holly, nominated her for the award.

She originally studied GCSEs in Maths and English - at the college’s Rhos-on-Sea and Abergele campuses respectively - before gaining a place on the Access to Higher Education (HE) - Health course at Rhos.

She is now studying adult nursing at Bangor University, which she started last September.

Before her college studies, Nicola previously worked as a carer in the community for several years.

But she had always wanted to go into the adult nursing field, so sat the required GCSEs before enrolling on the Access to HE course.

Nicola has dyslexia, which made the literacy side of the course very difficult, so she had to work twice as hard.

Not happy with just passing her units, she got distinctions across the board.

Nicola said: “I couldn’t believe it when I was told that I had won the award; I didn’t even know that Holly had entered me!

“I will use the money to buy a much-needed printer to help with my university course.

“There are so many apps now to aid dyslexics, and the university has been brilliant, even supplying me with a Dictaphone.

“I had an amazing time at college. Both my tutors and my classmates were so supportive. I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support.”

Nicola would eventually like a career as a practitioner/prescriber.

"Over the next 10 weeks, an inquest jury will hear details of how four young gay man met their deaths at the hands of the serial killer between June 2014 and September 2015.

The hearings, which were postponed due to the pandemic, are being held at Barking Town Hall – just yards from where the victims were dumped by Port after being administered fatal overdoses of GHB.

They come six years after Port’s 16-month killing spree was brought to an end, following the death of the final victim.

Barking Town Hall (Wiki)

In 2016, 46-year-old Port, from Barking, was found guilty of murders of fashion student Gabriel Kovari, 22, from Lewisham, former Dartford Grammar schoolboy Daniel Whitworth, 21 from Gravesend, Anthony Walgate, 23, a fashion student from Hull and Jack Taylor, 25, a forklift truck driver from Dagenham.

Since then, the victims’ families have continued to campaign for answers as to why Port was not stopped sooner.

On Monday, their lawyer Neil Hudgell, of Hudgell Solicitors, said: “It has been seven years and three months since Anthony Walgate was murdered; seven years and one month since Gabriel Kovari was murdered; just over seven years since Daniel Whitworth was murdered; and just over six years since Jack Taylor was murdered.

“Their families have felt every single day of their absence.

“They have waited with great patience and conducted themselves with real dignity.

“Yet, they’ve always wondered about whether there would have been a different outcome if the police had investigated Port properly and taken their concerns seriously, and if their boys hadn’t been gay.

“For them, the inquests mark a key step in their quest for accountability.”

A senior Metropolitan Police officer offered an apology to the victims’ families and highlighted changes the force had made since the Port case.

Commander Jon Savell said: “Our thoughts are firstly with the family and friends of those murdered by Stephen Port. We know this will be a painful and difficult time for them, hearing details once more of what happened to their loved ones.”

He said the Met was offering “every assistance” to the coroner and welcomed a “full examination of all the facts surrounding the tragic deaths”.

He said: “At the time of Port’s conviction, we apologised to the victims’ families and Daniel Whitworth’s partner for how we initially responded to the deaths, and I would like to apologise again.

“Since Port’s offences came to light we have worked hard within the Met to improve both our processes and our wider knowledge across the organisation of a range of issues associated with the murders.

“We will not prejudge the findings of the inquests but we will review any more improvements the jury and coroner identify that we need to make.

“It is extremely important to us that members of the LGBT+ communities trust the police and feel confident they are being provided with the best possible service.”

On Friday, Sarah Munro, assistant coroner for the East London area, told jurors to focus on the evidence in court as they were sworn in to hear the inquests.

She told them: “On Tuesday… we will commence hearing inquests into the deaths of four young men who were murdered by a man called Stephen Port in 2014 and 2015.

“They were killed by him with overdoses of a date rape drug called GHB and their bodies were discarded by him yards from where we are sitting now.”

The families of the victims, who are represented in court, are expected to attend the inquests.

"Over the next three days, a wide variety of Welsh and Irish poets, writers, singers and artists will be appearing in the Welsh-Irish festival at various venues throughout the town.

The Clebran discussions taking place at Mwldan 2 will include a cultural debate hosted by DJ Huw Stephens and featuring First Minister Mark Drakeford tomorrow afternoon.

“We at Mwldan are truly thrilled and delighted to welcome back Other Voices to Cardigan,” said chief executive Dilwyn Davies.

“Back in 2019, none of us could have imagined it would take so long for us to gather together again to enjoy an amazing weekend of music here at the edge of west Wales.

“As our communities in Ireland and Wales reach out to each other across the Irish Sea, so we gain a richness in our lives that helps us look to a brighter future as small nations with big hearts and ideas.

“To our partners Other Voices and Triongl, to our artists and audiences, and to our funders in Welsh Government and Irish Government, we offer a huge welcome to Cardigan and our heartfelt thanks for helping to make this remarkable and precious festival become a reality again.”

St Mary’s Church takes centre stage from tomorrow when singer Gwenno performs tracks from her third full-length solo album Tresor, written almost entirely in Cornish.

The evening will also see renowned harpist Catrin Finch team up with Dublin violinist Aoife Ni Bhriain to reveal their stunning new collaboration for the first time before a live audience.

Together, Aoife and Catrin are said to form a fearless and intrepid virtuoso duo, anxious to explore a musical world of creative possibility, challenge and discovery, and linked by the cultural, linguistic and political ties of their home countries.

The second part of Friday night’s entertainment features Sage Todz, a Welsh rap, hip-hop and R&B artist, and the Llareggub Brass Band, whose music invokes the sumptuous flavours of New Orleans marching bands, together with Bronx-inspired hip-hop and Welsh language pop music.

Saturday night sees the indie pop of Stella Donnelly, Welsh artist producer and writer L E M F R E C K, who excels in unique storytelling through music and self-directed visuals, Poppy Ajudha’s unique blend of Soul, R&B, Jazz and Pop and critically-acclaimed alt-pop rising star Mauvey.

The Clebran discussions taking place at Mwldan 2 will include a cultural debate hosted by DJ Huw Stephens and featuring First Minister Mark Drakeford tomorrow afternoon.

“We at Mwldan are truly thrilled and delighted to welcome back Other Voices to Cardigan,” said chief executive Dilwyn Davies.

“Back in 2019, none of us could have imagined it would take so long for us to gather together again to enjoy an amazing weekend of music here at the edge of west Wales.

“As our communities in Ireland and Wales reach out to each other across the Irish Sea, so we gain a richness in our lives that helps us look to a brighter future as small nations with big hearts and ideas.

“To our partners Other Voices and Triongl, to our artists and audiences, and to our funders in Welsh Government and Irish Government, we offer a huge welcome to Cardigan and our heartfelt thanks for helping to make this remarkable and precious festival become a reality again.”

St Mary’s Church takes centre stage from tomorrow when singer Gwenno performs tracks from her third full-length solo album Tresor, written almost entirely in Cornish.

The evening will also see renowned harpist Catrin Finch team up with Dublin violinist Aoife Ni Bhriain to reveal their stunning new collaboration for the first time before a live audience.

Together, Aoife and Catrin are said to form a fearless and intrepid virtuoso duo, anxious to explore a musical world of creative possibility, challenge and discovery, and linked by the cultural, linguistic and political ties of their home countries.

The second part of Friday night’s entertainment features Sage Todz, a Welsh rap, hip-hop and R&B artist, and the Llareggub Brass Band, whose music invokes the sumptuous flavours of New Orleans marching bands, together with Bronx-inspired hip-hop and Welsh language pop music.

Saturday night sees the indie pop of Stella Donnelly, Welsh artist producer and writer L E M F R E C K, who excels in unique storytelling through music and self-directed visuals, Poppy Ajudha’s unique blend of Soul, R&B, Jazz and Pop and critically-acclaimed alt-pop rising star Mauvey.

"Parkside Colliery closed in 1993

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

Parkside Regeneration is a joint venture between developer Langtree and St Helens Council.

Yvonne Fovargue MP

John Downes, chairman of Parkside Regeneration, told Business Desk: “It’s been a long road, but we got there.

“I’m delighted that the Secretary of State saw as clearly as we did Parkside’s potential for transformational change and the contribution it will make to re-balancing the borough’s economy.

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

""I objected to this application on the grounds of its encroachment on the greenbelt, traffic congestion and air quality. It was a development too far and I am pleased that the Planning Inspector dismissed the appeal by Peel Investments.”",ID_57,Parkside Colliery,St. Helens; Warrington,Wigan,wigantoday.net,article-1356090

“Work starts today on what we need to do to get spades in the ground. There’ll be lots going on behind the scenes that people won’t see, but we’ve already pushed the ‘go’ button.”

Councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, Deputy Leader of St Helens Council and Newton-le-Willows ward member, added: “Parkside has been a derelict colliery site since the pit was closed and 2,000 local workers lost their jobs in the early 1990s. It is fantastic news that the Government have respected local democracy and allowed the site to be brought back in to use to create employment opportunities for local residents.

“This also comes with over £800,000 of funding through s106 to improve local parks and green areas, schemes to get locals into the new jobs, new bus and cycle routes to the site and acres of new public parkland.

“We have always said that development must come with adequate infrastructure, and the new Parkside Link Road addresses that concern with a direct link to the M6.

“This is great news for Newton-le-Willows and job creation in the area, providing much needed jobs, investment and infrastructure.”

But, just up the road, the plan for Haydock Point was rejected by St Helens Council after some councillors branded it a “monstrosity” which would cause too much damage to the environment both because it would be built on green belt and because of the extra HGVs that would be driving around the area.

That decision has now been upheld by Mr Gove.

The news was hailed by Makerfield's MP.

Yvonne Fovargue said: “I welcome the decision to dismiss the appeal.

""I objected to this application on the grounds of its encroachment on the greenbelt, traffic congestion and air quality. It was a development too far and I am pleased that the Planning Inspector dismissed the appeal by Peel Investments.”",ID_57,the North West,Nottingham,Wigan,wigantoday.net,article-1356090
"Parkside Colliery closed in 1993

Secretary of State for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has approved the regeneration of Parkside Colliery at Newton-le-Willows, unlocking huge investment.

But a major logistics park just off the M6 called Haydock Park, which backers said, would have created 2,550 jobs, has been turned down.

It is three decades since Parkside stopped producing coal, one of the last mines in the North West to close.

The Haydock Point project was rejected by St Helens Council and the secretary of state

Since then the site has been the subject of numerous plans for redevelopment which have come to nothing.

However now, a new project providing 1,330 new jobs when fully complete as a major logistics hub, has been predicted to add more than £80m a year to the local economy and provide £2.2m a year in business rates to support local services.

The scheme was ""called in"" for an inquiry in May 2020 by the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick.

"People have two weeks to have their say on what should happen to statues and other landmarks in the City of London with links to slavery and historic racism.

Since it launched in September, more than 800 responses have been received to the City of London Corporation’s consultative exercise on the issue, which runs until 24 November.

People are being asked to give their views on which landmarks – including statues, street and building names – they think are a problem, and what action they think should be taken.

The consultative exercise was launched by the City Corporation’s Tackling Racism Taskforce, set up in the summer in the wake of the Black Lives Matters protests to look at what the organisation can do to tackle racism in all its forms.

Andrien Meyers, Co-Chair of the taskforce, said: “Since this exercise launched, we’ve received a really wide range of views on our historic landmarks and what people think we should do with them.

“There’s still time for people to have their say and I’d encourage anyone who has not yet taken part to give us their views and ensure their voice is heard.”

NOW READ: Timeline of Mayor’s feud with President as Trump set to leave office

Statues which respondents have mentioned include those at Guildhall – the City Corporation’s headquarters – depicting former Lord Mayor William Beckford and MP and philanthropist Sir John Cass, both of whom profited from the slave trade.

In September, Sir John Cass’s Foundation Primary School in the City announced it was changing its name to The Aldgate School to break the link with its controversial founder.

Caroline Addy, Co-Chair of the taskforce, said: “This is an issue which raises strong emotions but it’s important we listen to a broad cross section of opinion before taking an informed, measured decision on what should happen to our historic landmarks.”

The consultative exercise is seeking opinions on landmarks in the City of London and on City Corporation-owned sites outside the Square Mile. City firms, cultural institutions and political bodies across the capital and nationally are also being asked for their views.

All submissions received will be considered before a recommendation is made by the Taskforce to the City Corporation’s Policy and Resources Committee for a final decision.

"People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

Five people were fined by the PSNI during a protest organised by the Northern Ireland feminist group ROSA in Belfast's Writer's Square on Tuesday evening.

The event, which was described as a ""socially distanced stand-out"", involved dozens gathering in the area with placards, protesting against violence perpetrated towards women.

The event was organised by ROSA NI - a socialist feminist movement that operates across the island of Ireland. During the event, organisers chanted and called for an end to violence against women.

The event follows the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who went missing after walking home from a friend’s flat in London on March 3

Her remains were later discovered in an area of woodland in Ashford in Kent a week later.

A member of the Met Police has been charged in relation to her kidnap and murder.

One speaker at the Belfast event on Tuesday said: ""We are here for Sarah Everard. We are here because at a vigil on Saturday, attendees were brutally oppressed. We are here because it is clear that we are not safe in our homes. We are not safe in our workplaces and we are not safe in our streets.""

People in Writer's Square, Belfast, taking part in a demonstration against gender violence and to defend the right to protest following the murder of Sarah Everard Liam McBurney/PA Wire

On a statement on social media, the group urged those attending to ensure social distancing was followed and also that anyone attending also wore masks and sanitised their hands.

""We’ve called this action in solidarity with all victims and survivors of gender-based violence and with those protesting the murder of Sarah Everard who have faced disgraceful police repression,"" they said.

""It’s clear that gender-based violence is a daily reality for women & non-binary people, and the assembly has failed to effectively tackle this crisis.

""Today, Writer’s Square, Belfast at 6pm, we’ll be taking a stand to defend the right to protest, to oppose the repression against those attending Saturday’s vigil, and to demand an end to gender-based violence.

""The response of the Met police was totally abhorrent, and underlines what socialist feminists have been saying : that the entire system is complicit in perpetuating violence and misogyny.""

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

“Shortly before 6pm, approximately around 20 people had gathered at the event which was peaceful. This number quickly grew to approximately 100.

""As a result, officers engaged with the event organisers and explained and encouraged people to comply with the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020. Subsequently, five people were issued with Fixed Penalty Notices under the Health Protection Regulations.

“We would appeal to everyone to adhere to the current Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations to play their part in slowing the spread of this virus and helping everyone stay safe and save lives.”",ID_59,Belfast,Belfast,Belfast,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,article-1371260

The event in Belfast follows other similar ""reclaim the streets"" events in Dublin and also the high profile vigil in Clapham Common in London on Saturday when met Police officers clashed with crowds gathered.

In a statement, Superintendent David Moore from the PSNI said: ""Police were in attendance at a planned protest which took place at the Writer’s Square area of Belfast this evening

“Shortly before 6pm, approximately around 20 people had gathered at the event which was peaceful. This number quickly grew to approximately 100.

""As a result, officers engaged with the event organisers and explained and encouraged people to comply with the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations NI 2020. Subsequently, five people were issued with Fixed Penalty Notices under the Health Protection Regulations.

“We would appeal to everyone to adhere to the current Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations to play their part in slowing the spread of this virus and helping everyone stay safe and save lives.”",ID_59,Clapham Common,Lambeth; Lancaster; Worthing,Belfast,belfasttelegraph.co.uk,article-1371260
"Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds. A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training in

Petroc Netball team progressed to the third round of the Cup after a confident 31 – 16 victory over their visitors from Richard Huish 3rds.

A solid first-half performance from the girls was pleasing to watch for the coaches, as they put their training into practice with lots of movement off the ball and some good interceptions whilst defending. The shooters also put in a shift working the circle well.

Huish fought back in the second half but Petroc always looked pretty comfortable and ran out winners with Jessica Goodfellow getting the player of the match award.

Unfortunately, the good news did not extend to the football pitch, as Petroc Men bowed out of their competition.

Petroc travelled, once again, to Taunton to the grass pitch at Richard Huish 1sts, knowing a tough test awaited them.

After an even start, the breakthrough came late in the half when a long ball wasn't dealt with and the Huish attacker managed to nod the ball over the advancing Liam Loftus in the Petroc goal and Pat Henry couldn't quite wrap his foot far enough around the ball to keep it out.

The second half was just as tight, with both sides creating chances but, as time went on, Petroc had no choice but to push forward, which left the inevitable gaps at the back.

Huish snatched a decisive second when a cross from the right and a late third confirmed the Petroc exit.

Not the result Petroc were looking for but there were plenty of positives to take away and use going forwards in the league for the remainder of the season.

Petroc now look forward to the week after half term with Men's football playing in the Regional 7-a-side championships, Netball at home to SGS and a mixed volleyball cup tie at home to, yes, you've guessed it, Richard Huish!

There are open evenings on November 1 & 2 at the main Barnstaple campus and the team would love to chat about sport with anyone considering a course at Petroc.",ID_60,Taunton,Somerset; Tameside,North Devon,northdevongazette.co.uk,article-1379817
"Police love acronyms.
They learn them by heart, pick them up from older coppers, accept them from senior officers and if you ever listened to a police radio when you could still pick it up on your transistor you may have even heard a few.
Of course, we can’t listen to police radios anymore because the Airwave system is uncrackable. But the acronyms remain and we sometimes hear them used on TV cop shows which try to be authentic-sounding.

The vast majority of them are merely a shorthand way of explaining important information, roles, incidents or titles.
But occasionally, like a lot of organisations who deal with the public, they create special codewords which are, shall we say, less PC than a PC…
Here's our guide to police slang. You'll find the official terms at the top - and a few unofficial phrases at the end of the article.
The official terms
LOS – Lost or Stolen (“The car’s LOS, Sarge…”)
CRO – Criminal Records Office or Criminal Record (“Sarge, he’s got a CRO)
PNC – Police National Computer
RTC – Road Traffic Collision, which used to be RTA (Road Traffic Accident) until, as any Hot Fuzz film fan knows, vocab guidelines state police no longer refer to such incidents as ‘accidents’, they’re now collisions. Because ‘accident’ implies there's nobody to blame.
Misper – a Missing Person (“Sarge, is Lord Lucan still a misper?”)
TWOC – Taking Without Owner's Consent (“Ere, bey, have you been done for twokking cars again?”)
PSU - Police Support Unit is a team of officers trained in public order and are used in major incidents, support other officers and bashing in doors with the Big Red Key (see later). In Devon and Cornwall they are now called the FSG – Force Support Group. The Metropolitan Police had a similar team called the SPG – Special Patrol Group. They were heavily criticised following their policing of an Anti-Nazi League demonstration where a demonstrator was struck with a baton and died. They were then renamed the TSG – Territorial Support Group. Just like how Windscale was renamed Sellafield after the nuclear power plant had a rather unfortunate fire.
FLO – Family Liaison Officer. These are officers who work closely with victims of serious crimes, such as the family of murder victims, or tragic deaths such as fatal road collisions.
TK – Telephone Kiosk. One officer admitted that in their early days on the job they were told to attend an incident at a “TK at Royal Parade”. They spent several minutes interviewing staff at TK Maxx before being told over the radio they were in the wrong place.
CHIS – Covert Human Intelligence Source. Alternatively known in court as “an informant”. Known in common parlance as a “grass” or “snitch” who may eventually come to a violent end. Hence the phrase “snitches get stitches”.
POLAC – Police Accident. Usually a road accident involving a police vehicle. This will inevitably lead to the aforementioned driver having to purchase a large quantity of cakes for his laughing colleagues back at the station. (“Sorry Sarge, I think I may have reversed the riot van into your new Audi”)
OIC – Officer In Case (“Right, Constable Crap-driver, you’re now the OIC on this abducted-by-alien complaint”)
SIO – Senior Investigating Officer
POLSA – Police Search Advisor – a specially-trained officer who advises on the best approach to carry out searches in Misper cases or suspected murders where bodies are yet to be found.
Code 11 – Off duty (“Sorry Sarge, I can’t attend that alien abduction, I’m Code 11 as of 10 minutes ago”)
ASNT – Area Search No Trace. When police have searched area for a suspect but there’s no trace of them.
DL – Driving Licence (“Sarge, got a little green man here with what looks like a dodgy DL”)
Code 4 – a meal break. (“Can someone else go to that Sarge, I’m Code 4?”)
RJ - Restorative Justice. (“Well Sarge, could he at least repaint the fence he’s drawn a k**b on? The victim is okay with some RJ”)
CIM - Critical Incident Manager. Invariably an Inspector rank officer who oversees all the live “critical” incidents going on in the area and makes the decisions which ensure these situations don’t get any worse.
NFP – Normal For Plymouth (“Sarge, we found the naked bloke wearing a tutu, off his head on mushrooms and mumbling something about ‘Green Army’.” “Yes lad, that’s NFP”.)
(Image: Carl Eve)
NFA – No Further Action. When police either cannot get the evidence to convince the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) to go for a charge, the case is dropped and the person is told there will be NFA
RUI – Released Under Investigation. Since bail has been hurled out the door by the Government, people are told they are not on bail, but they are RUI and can be arrested at any moment as inquiries continue. This has been sold to the public by the Government as a good thing. No-one in the police thinks it is a good thing.
NPAS – National Police Air Service. As part of a cost-cutting exercise police helicopters were taken out of police force’s control and a single body was created to cover the country.
FPN – Fixed Penalty Notice. Effectively a fine handed to you by police
AIO – All In Order (“Sarge, I’ve check the house where the Demis Roussos was being played louder than a jet engine. It’s AIO”)
WOA – Words Of Advice (“Sarge, we pulled the driver over who had a cow in the back seat of his Land Rover and, as it’s NFP we’ve given him WOA”)
(Image: Jon Bishop)
UNIFI – Unified Police Intelligence. The police’s crime, intelligence and custody computer database. It sends officers mad trying to get it to work. Imagine Windows 89 but on its last legs.
NOIP – Notice of Intended Prosecution. Effectively a note which tells you your future may well involve a court visit.
SOCA – Serious and Organised Crime. As opposed to Jocular and Erratic Crime. This is the environment where you encounter men called Dave with broken noses and leather jackets who keep money in large rolls, run a scrap metal merchants and can get you a shooter to go with a kilo of coke.
SOCIT – Serious and Organised Crime Investigation Team. Where Detectives go when they want to be their childhood heroes, Bodie and Doyle.
SOCO – Scene of Crime Officer (“Sarge, can you get CIS down here for forensics?” “No Constable Savage, this isn’t CSI Miami - in Plymouth we call them SOCOs”)
SODAIT – Sexual Offences and Domestic Abuse Investigation Team.

SOPO – Sex Offenders Prevention Order. An order by the court which attempts to keep sex offenders from committing sex offences. Considered by many Plymouth people to be less effective than a cigar cutter.
SOR – Sex Offenders Register. You can end up on this list from doing everything from patting a person of the opposite sex on the bottom against their wishes to the serial rape of children.
ASBO – Antisocial Behaviour Order. Considered by some to be a badge of honour, although not an ideal addition to your CV.
(Image: Carl Eve)
ABE – Achieving Best Evidence. Where victims of serious sexual assaults are video interviewed for their very first statement, which can then be used in court.
BCU – Basic Command Unit is the largest unit into which territorial British Police forces are divided. Plymouth is populated enough to be an entire BCU. Remarkably, the entire county of Cornwall is just one BCU. In the same way that it’s one sandwich short of a picnic.
D & D – Drunk and Disorderly, not Dungeons and Dragons.
Section 165 – No insurance seizure. Where a vehicle is seized by police and may well be crushed because the driver had not insurance.
Section 59 – Antisocial behaviour order vehicle seizure. Where the owner has previously been formerly warned for their antisocial driving and yet has continued to drive like a prat, and thus lose their vehicle.
PSU – Public order Support Unit. Usually a police van/people carrier which everyone outside of the police force call a “riot van”. Usually has a pack of Haribo in between the two front seats.
MOE – Method of Entry. (“Sarge, we’re going to use the chainsaw through the front door as our MOE”.)
AP – Aggrieved Person. The injured party. The victim.
ARV – Armed Response Vehicle. A vehicle with armed response officers (and their guns). Often heavily ladened with “Gucci gear” (police-style equipment which is not standard issue gear and is instead purchased by ARV officers from numerous US-type websites because it looks cool/imposing/flash/intimidating)
Big Red Key – battering ram for smashing down doors. It’s big. It’s red. It opens doors.
(Image: Carl Eve)
OT – Overtime (“Sarge, will I be getting any OT for this?”)
Hooly Bar – a large iron bar with a large spike at the end. Used for smashing in windows and distracting occupants while another officer uses the Big Red Key to gain entry. Usually at properties where illegal recreational pharmaceuticals are being kept, grown, created, smoked, ingested, injected.
Refs – Food. (“Sarge, I’ve been on scene guard for six hours. Any chance of some Refs”)
Spray – Captor canister incapacitant. AKA pepper spray.
Stabby – A protective vest worn by officers in the hope it will minimise the risk of being stabbed.

Of course occasionally unexpected phrases can turn up in the most unlikely of places:
For many years Charles Cross police station went under the code “EC” while Crownhill had the code EL which stems from the old alpha area codes with Plymouth being the E division and the next letter being the first or last letter of the station.
However, a few years back it was decided to change all the codes, such as the Criminal Investigation Department which went by the well-known name CID. That became the Local Investigation Team - a LIT. And thus Charles Cross unexpectedly enjoyed having its very own CLIT.
Female detectives at that department remarked that on the first day of the changeover, none of the male officers turned up for work in the office because they couldn’t find it.
The fun stuff
While the official list of acronyms runs to an entire booklet with more than 300 terms, there are some acronyms and policing phrases which have eased their way into common police parlance and very few of them are half as polite or politically correct. However, we must keep in mind, policing can be a dark job on occasions and dark humour grows in such places.
FUBAR BUNDY – F***** Up Beyond Any Recovery But Unfortunately Not Dead Yet. (“Sarge, that scrote who’s been battering old ladies and mugging them has come off his stolen scooter. He’s FUBAR BUNDY.”)
Code Brown – A close shave. (“Sarge, Sarge, that concrete block thrown from the multi-story just missed my head. I’m proper Code Brown here Sarge!”)
Jeremy Kyle referral – A person of the like one would expect to appear on a popular daytime TV show where various wastrels, ne’er do wells and vagabonds are given DNA checks but not dental treatment.
GTP – Good To Police. A sympathetic or welcoming shop/café/organisation/resident. Such as a resident who offers a cup of tea to officers who are on scene guard in the pouring rain.
Furry Exocet – a Police Dog (see also, Land Shark and Hairy Exocet)
ATNS – like ASNT, but it’s where the likelihood of anyone being around is less than zero, so Area Traced, No Search.
Gidgy – A deployment considered by officers to be a “piece of p***”. A job where there is the pretence of working, but being able to do so without to actually do anything. A bit like SPLB duty – Shuffle Paper, Look Busy.
BINGO seat – Bollocks I’m Not Getting Out seat. The back seat in the PSU carrier.
BONGO – Books On, Never Goes Out. A lazy cop.
LOB – Load of Bollocks. Often used when describing a false or grossly exaggerated call from a MOP - Member of Public. (“Sarge, you were asking about that kidnap, serial killer, alien invasion job… it’s a LOB, close the log.”)
GDP or WDP – Greater Dorset Police or West Dorset Police. A term used to describe Devon and Cornwall Police since so many of its departments have now been taken over by Dorset Police. A term often used by other neighbouring forces when they wish to chide, josh or ridicule Devon and Cornwall Police officers.
A Unit – A person who is considered quite muscular and may cause officers a little bit of trouble.
A Big Unit – A big person, who will definitely cause officers a bit of trouble if he chooses to.
FBU – F****** Big Unit. An awfully big person. (“Sarge, can we have a few more officers please. This bloke you’ve told us to arrest said he won’t come out of the pub and he’s an FBU”)
DODI – Dead One Did It. Used in reference to single vehicle fatal RTCs where there is only one occupant of the vehicle in question.
DILLIGAF – Do I Look Like I Give A F***? A response offered when a MOP indignantly asks for the officer’s name. (“Certainly Sir, I’m Sgt Dilligaf, now would you please blow into this bag. No, this one, not that second one you can see…”)
FLUB – F***ing Lazy Useless B***ard. A term used out of earshot for a very disagreeable and inept officer, who is also possibly corrupt.
NFI – No F***ing Interest (“Sarge, I’ve spoken to the neighbours about it and they’ve NFI”)
PLONK – Person of Little Or No Knowledge. (“Sarge, we’ve spoken to the AP, they’re a PLONK)
RAT- Really Adept at Traffic Law (“Sarge, I’ve got a RAT here who’s convinced driving at 60mph in a 30mph is a Human Right”.)
The final synonym offered to Plymouth Live from an anonymous source was: “When asked for directions, you point at the hat and cap badge and advise them “It says E II R, not A to Z”.
There’s probably hundreds of others, both legitimate and illegitimate. Tell us any you’ve heard.

BCU – Basic Command Unit is the largest unit into which territorial British Police forces are divided. Plymouth is populated enough to be an entire BCU. Remarkably, the entire county of Cornwall is just one BCU. In the same way that it’s one sandwich short of a picnic.
D & D – Drunk and Disorderly, not Dungeons and Dragons.
Section 165 – No insurance seizure. Where a vehicle is seized by police and may well be crushed because the driver had not insurance.
Section 59 – Antisocial behaviour order vehicle seizure. Where the owner has previously been formerly warned for their antisocial driving and yet has continued to drive like a prat, and thus lose their vehicle.
PSU – Public order Support Unit. Usually a police van/people carrier which everyone outside of the police force call a “riot van”. Usually has a pack of Haribo in between the two front seats.
MOE – Method of Entry. (“Sarge, we’re going to use the chainsaw through the front door as our MOE”.)
AP – Aggrieved Person. The injured party. The victim.
ARV – Armed Response Vehicle. A vehicle with armed response officers (and their guns). Often heavily ladened with “Gucci gear” (police-style equipment which is not standard issue gear and is instead purchased by ARV officers from numerous US-type websites because it looks cool/imposing/flash/intimidating)
Big Red Key – battering ram for smashing down doors. It’s big. It’s red. It opens doors.
(Image: Carl Eve)
OT – Overtime (“Sarge, will I be getting any OT for this?”)
Hooly Bar – a large iron bar with a large spike at the end. Used for smashing in windows and distracting occupants while another officer uses the Big Red Key to gain entry. Usually at properties where illegal recreational pharmaceuticals are being kept, grown, created, smoked, ingested, injected.
Refs – Food. (“Sarge, I’ve been on scene guard for six hours. Any chance of some Refs”)
Spray – Captor canister incapacitant. AKA pepper spray.
Stabby – A protective vest worn by officers in the hope it will minimise the risk of being stabbed.

Of course occasionally unexpected phrases can turn up in the most unlikely of places:
For many years Charles Cross police station went under the code “EC” while Crownhill had the code EL which stems from the old alpha area codes with Plymouth being the E division and the next letter being the first or last letter of the station.
However, a few years back it was decided to change all the codes, such as the Criminal Investigation Department which went by the well-known name CID. That became the Local Investigation Team - a LIT. And thus Charles Cross unexpectedly enjoyed having its very own CLIT.
Female detectives at that department remarked that on the first day of the changeover, none of the male officers turned up for work in the office because they couldn’t find it.
The fun stuff
While the official list of acronyms runs to an entire booklet with more than 300 terms, there are some acronyms and policing phrases which have eased their way into common police parlance and very few of them are half as polite or politically correct. However, we must keep in mind, policing can be a dark job on occasions and dark humour grows in such places.
FUBAR BUNDY – F***** Up Beyond Any Recovery But Unfortunately Not Dead Yet. (“Sarge, that scrote who’s been battering old ladies and mugging them has come off his stolen scooter. He’s FUBAR BUNDY.”)
Code Brown – A close shave. (“Sarge, Sarge, that concrete block thrown from the multi-story just missed my head. I’m proper Code Brown here Sarge!”)
Jeremy Kyle referral – A person of the like one would expect to appear on a popular daytime TV show where various wastrels, ne’er do wells and vagabonds are given DNA checks but not dental treatment.
GTP – Good To Police. A sympathetic or welcoming shop/café/organisation/resident. Such as a resident who offers a cup of tea to officers who are on scene guard in the pouring rain.
Furry Exocet – a Police Dog (see also, Land Shark and Hairy Exocet)
ATNS – like ASNT, but it’s where the likelihood of anyone being around is less than zero, so Area Traced, No Search.
Gidgy – A deployment considered by officers to be a “piece of p***”. A job where there is the pretence of working, but being able to do so without to actually do anything. A bit like SPLB duty – Shuffle Paper, Look Busy.
BINGO seat – Bollocks I’m Not Getting Out seat. The back seat in the PSU carrier.
BONGO – Books On, Never Goes Out. A lazy cop.
LOB – Load of Bollocks. Often used when describing a false or grossly exaggerated call from a MOP - Member of Public. (“Sarge, you were asking about that kidnap, serial killer, alien invasion job… it’s a LOB, close the log.”)
GDP or WDP – Greater Dorset Police or West Dorset Police. A term used to describe Devon and Cornwall Police since so many of its departments have now been taken over by Dorset Police. A term often used by other neighbouring forces when they wish to chide, josh or ridicule Devon and Cornwall Police officers.
A Unit – A person who is considered quite muscular and may cause officers a little bit of trouble.
A Big Unit – A big person, who will definitely cause officers a bit of trouble if he chooses to.
FBU – F****** Big Unit. An awfully big person. (“Sarge, can we have a few more officers please. This bloke you’ve told us to arrest said he won’t come out of the pub and he’s an FBU”)
DODI – Dead One Did It. Used in reference to single vehicle fatal RTCs where there is only one occupant of the vehicle in question.
DILLIGAF – Do I Look Like I Give A F***? A response offered when a MOP indignantly asks for the officer’s name. (“Certainly Sir, I’m Sgt Dilligaf, now would you please blow into this bag. No, this one, not that second one you can see…”)
FLUB – F***ing Lazy Useless B***ard. A term used out of earshot for a very disagreeable and inept officer, who is also possibly corrupt.
NFI – No F***ing Interest (“Sarge, I’ve spoken to the neighbours about it and they’ve NFI”)
PLONK – Person of Little Or No Knowledge. (“Sarge, we’ve spoken to the AP, they’re a PLONK)
RAT- Really Adept at Traffic Law (“Sarge, I’ve got a RAT here who’s convinced driving at 60mph in a 30mph is a Human Right”.)
The final synonym offered to Plymouth Live from an anonymous source was: “When asked for directions, you point at the hat and cap badge and advise them “It says E II R, not A to Z”.
There’s probably hundreds of others, both legitimate and illegitimate. Tell us any you’ve heard.

How to find out if a sex offender lives near you",ID_61,Windscale,Cumberland,Plymouth,plymouthherald.co.uk,article-1431283
"Police love acronyms.
They learn them by heart, pick them up from older coppers, accept them from senior officers and if you ever listened to a police radio when you could still pick it up on your transistor you may have even heard a few.
Of course, we can’t listen to police radios anymore because the Airwave system is uncrackable. But the acronyms remain and we sometimes hear them used on TV cop shows which try to be authentic-sounding.

The vast majority of them are merely a shorthand way of explaining important information, roles, incidents or titles.
But occasionally, like a lot of organisations who deal with the public, they create special codewords which are, shall we say, less PC than a PC…
Here's our guide to police slang. You'll find the official terms at the top - and a few unofficial phrases at the end of the article.
The official terms
LOS – Lost or Stolen (“The car’s LOS, Sarge…”)
CRO – Criminal Records Office or Criminal Record (“Sarge, he’s got a CRO)
PNC – Police National Computer
RTC – Road Traffic Collision, which used to be RTA (Road Traffic Accident) until, as any Hot Fuzz film fan knows, vocab guidelines state police no longer refer to such incidents as ‘accidents’, they’re now collisions. Because ‘accident’ implies there's nobody to blame.
Misper – a Missing Person (“Sarge, is Lord Lucan still a misper?”)
TWOC – Taking Without Owner's Consent (“Ere, bey, have you been done for twokking cars again?”)
PSU - Police Support Unit is a team of officers trained in public order and are used in major incidents, support other officers and bashing in doors with the Big Red Key (see later). In Devon and Cornwall they are now called the FSG – Force Support Group. The Metropolitan Police had a similar team called the SPG – Special Patrol Group. They were heavily criticised following their policing of an Anti-Nazi League demonstration where a demonstrator was struck with a baton and died. They were then renamed the TSG – Territorial Support Group. Just like how Windscale was renamed Sellafield after the nuclear power plant had a rather unfortunate fire.
FLO – Family Liaison Officer. These are officers who work closely with victims of serious crimes, such as the family of murder victims, or tragic deaths such as fatal road collisions.
TK – Telephone Kiosk. One officer admitted that in their early days on the job they were told to attend an incident at a “TK at Royal Parade”. They spent several minutes interviewing staff at TK Maxx before being told over the radio they were in the wrong place.
CHIS – Covert Human Intelligence Source. Alternatively known in court as “an informant”. Known in common parlance as a “grass” or “snitch” who may eventually come to a violent end. Hence the phrase “snitches get stitches”.
POLAC – Police Accident. Usually a road accident involving a police vehicle. This will inevitably lead to the aforementioned driver having to purchase a large quantity of cakes for his laughing colleagues back at the station. (“Sorry Sarge, I think I may have reversed the riot van into your new Audi”)
OIC – Officer In Case (“Right, Constable Crap-driver, you’re now the OIC on this abducted-by-alien complaint”)
SIO – Senior Investigating Officer
POLSA – Police Search Advisor – a specially-trained officer who advises on the best approach to carry out searches in Misper cases or suspected murders where bodies are yet to be found.
Code 11 – Off duty (“Sorry Sarge, I can’t attend that alien abduction, I’m Code 11 as of 10 minutes ago”)
ASNT – Area Search No Trace. When police have searched area for a suspect but there’s no trace of them.
DL – Driving Licence (“Sarge, got a little green man here with what looks like a dodgy DL”)
Code 4 – a meal break. (“Can someone else go to that Sarge, I’m Code 4?”)
RJ - Restorative Justice. (“Well Sarge, could he at least repaint the fence he’s drawn a k**b on? The victim is okay with some RJ”)
CIM - Critical Incident Manager. Invariably an Inspector rank officer who oversees all the live “critical” incidents going on in the area and makes the decisions which ensure these situations don’t get any worse.
NFP – Normal For Plymouth (“Sarge, we found the naked bloke wearing a tutu, off his head on mushrooms and mumbling something about ‘Green Army’.” “Yes lad, that’s NFP”.)
(Image: Carl Eve)
NFA – No Further Action. When police either cannot get the evidence to convince the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) to go for a charge, the case is dropped and the person is told there will be NFA
RUI – Released Under Investigation. Since bail has been hurled out the door by the Government, people are told they are not on bail, but they are RUI and can be arrested at any moment as inquiries continue. This has been sold to the public by the Government as a good thing. No-one in the police thinks it is a good thing.
NPAS – National Police Air Service. As part of a cost-cutting exercise police helicopters were taken out of police force’s control and a single body was created to cover the country.
FPN – Fixed Penalty Notice. Effectively a fine handed to you by police
AIO – All In Order (“Sarge, I’ve check the house where the Demis Roussos was being played louder than a jet engine. It’s AIO”)
WOA – Words Of Advice (“Sarge, we pulled the driver over who had a cow in the back seat of his Land Rover and, as it’s NFP we’ve given him WOA”)
(Image: Jon Bishop)
UNIFI – Unified Police Intelligence. The police’s crime, intelligence and custody computer database. It sends officers mad trying to get it to work. Imagine Windows 89 but on its last legs.
NOIP – Notice of Intended Prosecution. Effectively a note which tells you your future may well involve a court visit.
SOCA – Serious and Organised Crime. As opposed to Jocular and Erratic Crime. This is the environment where you encounter men called Dave with broken noses and leather jackets who keep money in large rolls, run a scrap metal merchants and can get you a shooter to go with a kilo of coke.
SOCIT – Serious and Organised Crime Investigation Team. Where Detectives go when they want to be their childhood heroes, Bodie and Doyle.
SOCO – Scene of Crime Officer (“Sarge, can you get CIS down here for forensics?” “No Constable Savage, this isn’t CSI Miami - in Plymouth we call them SOCOs”)
SODAIT – Sexual Offences and Domestic Abuse Investigation Team.

SOPO – Sex Offenders Prevention Order. An order by the court which attempts to keep sex offenders from committing sex offences. Considered by many Plymouth people to be less effective than a cigar cutter.
SOR – Sex Offenders Register. You can end up on this list from doing everything from patting a person of the opposite sex on the bottom against their wishes to the serial rape of children.
ASBO – Antisocial Behaviour Order. Considered by some to be a badge of honour, although not an ideal addition to your CV.
(Image: Carl Eve)
ABE – Achieving Best Evidence. Where victims of serious sexual assaults are video interviewed for their very first statement, which can then be used in court.
BCU – Basic Command Unit is the largest unit into which territorial British Police forces are divided. Plymouth is populated enough to be an entire BCU. Remarkably, the entire county of Cornwall is just one BCU. In the same way that it’s one sandwich short of a picnic.
D & D – Drunk and Disorderly, not Dungeons and Dragons.
Section 165 – No insurance seizure. Where a vehicle is seized by police and may well be crushed because the driver had not insurance.
Section 59 – Antisocial behaviour order vehicle seizure. Where the owner has previously been formerly warned for their antisocial driving and yet has continued to drive like a prat, and thus lose their vehicle.
PSU – Public order Support Unit. Usually a police van/people carrier which everyone outside of the police force call a “riot van”. Usually has a pack of Haribo in between the two front seats.
MOE – Method of Entry. (“Sarge, we’re going to use the chainsaw through the front door as our MOE”.)
AP – Aggrieved Person. The injured party. The victim.
ARV – Armed Response Vehicle. A vehicle with armed response officers (and their guns). Often heavily ladened with “Gucci gear” (police-style equipment which is not standard issue gear and is instead purchased by ARV officers from numerous US-type websites because it looks cool/imposing/flash/intimidating)
Big Red Key – battering ram for smashing down doors. It’s big. It’s red. It opens doors.
(Image: Carl Eve)
OT – Overtime (“Sarge, will I be getting any OT for this?”)
Hooly Bar – a large iron bar with a large spike at the end. Used for smashing in windows and distracting occupants while another officer uses the Big Red Key to gain entry. Usually at properties where illegal recreational pharmaceuticals are being kept, grown, created, smoked, ingested, injected.
Refs – Food. (“Sarge, I’ve been on scene guard for six hours. Any chance of some Refs”)
Spray – Captor canister incapacitant. AKA pepper spray.
Stabby – A protective vest worn by officers in the hope it will minimise the risk of being stabbed.

Of course occasionally unexpected phrases can turn up in the most unlikely of places:
For many years Charles Cross police station went under the code “EC” while Crownhill had the code EL which stems from the old alpha area codes with Plymouth being the E division and the next letter being the first or last letter of the station.
However, a few years back it was decided to change all the codes, such as the Criminal Investigation Department which went by the well-known name CID. That became the Local Investigation Team - a LIT. And thus Charles Cross unexpectedly enjoyed having its very own CLIT.
Female detectives at that department remarked that on the first day of the changeover, none of the male officers turned up for work in the office because they couldn’t find it.
The fun stuff
While the official list of acronyms runs to an entire booklet with more than 300 terms, there are some acronyms and policing phrases which have eased their way into common police parlance and very few of them are half as polite or politically correct. However, we must keep in mind, policing can be a dark job on occasions and dark humour grows in such places.
FUBAR BUNDY – F***** Up Beyond Any Recovery But Unfortunately Not Dead Yet. (“Sarge, that scrote who’s been battering old ladies and mugging them has come off his stolen scooter. He’s FUBAR BUNDY.”)
Code Brown – A close shave. (“Sarge, Sarge, that concrete block thrown from the multi-story just missed my head. I’m proper Code Brown here Sarge!”)
Jeremy Kyle referral – A person of the like one would expect to appear on a popular daytime TV show where various wastrels, ne’er do wells and vagabonds are given DNA checks but not dental treatment.
GTP – Good To Police. A sympathetic or welcoming shop/café/organisation/resident. Such as a resident who offers a cup of tea to officers who are on scene guard in the pouring rain.
Furry Exocet – a Police Dog (see also, Land Shark and Hairy Exocet)
ATNS – like ASNT, but it’s where the likelihood of anyone being around is less than zero, so Area Traced, No Search.
Gidgy – A deployment considered by officers to be a “piece of p***”. A job where there is the pretence of working, but being able to do so without to actually do anything. A bit like SPLB duty – Shuffle Paper, Look Busy.
BINGO seat – Bollocks I’m Not Getting Out seat. The back seat in the PSU carrier.
BONGO – Books On, Never Goes Out. A lazy cop.
LOB – Load of Bollocks. Often used when describing a false or grossly exaggerated call from a MOP - Member of Public. (“Sarge, you were asking about that kidnap, serial killer, alien invasion job… it’s a LOB, close the log.”)
GDP or WDP – Greater Dorset Police or West Dorset Police. A term used to describe Devon and Cornwall Police since so many of its departments have now been taken over by Dorset Police. A term often used by other neighbouring forces when they wish to chide, josh or ridicule Devon and Cornwall Police officers.
A Unit – A person who is considered quite muscular and may cause officers a little bit of trouble.
A Big Unit – A big person, who will definitely cause officers a bit of trouble if he chooses to.
FBU – F****** Big Unit. An awfully big person. (“Sarge, can we have a few more officers please. This bloke you’ve told us to arrest said he won’t come out of the pub and he’s an FBU”)
DODI – Dead One Did It. Used in reference to single vehicle fatal RTCs where there is only one occupant of the vehicle in question.
DILLIGAF – Do I Look Like I Give A F***? A response offered when a MOP indignantly asks for the officer’s name. (“Certainly Sir, I’m Sgt Dilligaf, now would you please blow into this bag. No, this one, not that second one you can see…”)
FLUB – F***ing Lazy Useless B***ard. A term used out of earshot for a very disagreeable and inept officer, who is also possibly corrupt.
NFI – No F***ing Interest (“Sarge, I’ve spoken to the neighbours about it and they’ve NFI”)
PLONK – Person of Little Or No Knowledge. (“Sarge, we’ve spoken to the AP, they’re a PLONK)
RAT- Really Adept at Traffic Law (“Sarge, I’ve got a RAT here who’s convinced driving at 60mph in a 30mph is a Human Right”.)
The final synonym offered to Plymouth Live from an anonymous source was: “When asked for directions, you point at the hat and cap badge and advise them “It says E II R, not A to Z”.
There’s probably hundreds of others, both legitimate and illegitimate. Tell us any you’ve heard.

"Police love acronyms.
They learn them by heart, pick them up from older coppers, accept them from senior officers and if you ever listened to a police radio when you could still pick it up on your transistor you may have even heard a few.
Of course, we can’t listen to police radios anymore because the Airwave system is uncrackable. But the acronyms remain and we sometimes hear them used on TV cop shows which try to be authentic-sounding.

The vast majority of them are merely a shorthand way of explaining important information, roles, incidents or titles.
But occasionally, like a lot of organisations who deal with the public, they create special codewords which are, shall we say, less PC than a PC…
Here's our guide to police slang. You'll find the official terms at the top - and a few unofficial phrases at the end of the article.
The official terms
LOS – Lost or Stolen (“The car’s LOS, Sarge…”)
CRO – Criminal Records Office or Criminal Record (“Sarge, he’s got a CRO)
PNC – Police National Computer
RTC – Road Traffic Collision, which used to be RTA (Road Traffic Accident) until, as any Hot Fuzz film fan knows, vocab guidelines state police no longer refer to such incidents as ‘accidents’, they’re now collisions. Because ‘accident’ implies there's nobody to blame.
Misper – a Missing Person (“Sarge, is Lord Lucan still a misper?”)
TWOC – Taking Without Owner's Consent (“Ere, bey, have you been done for twokking cars again?”)
PSU - Police Support Unit is a team of officers trained in public order and are used in major incidents, support other officers and bashing in doors with the Big Red Key (see later). In Devon and Cornwall they are now called the FSG – Force Support Group. The Metropolitan Police had a similar team called the SPG – Special Patrol Group. They were heavily criticised following their policing of an Anti-Nazi League demonstration where a demonstrator was struck with a baton and died. They were then renamed the TSG – Territorial Support Group. Just like how Windscale was renamed Sellafield after the nuclear power plant had a rather unfortunate fire.
FLO – Family Liaison Officer. These are officers who work closely with victims of serious crimes, such as the family of murder victims, or tragic deaths such as fatal road collisions.
TK – Telephone Kiosk. One officer admitted that in their early days on the job they were told to attend an incident at a “TK at Royal Parade”. They spent several minutes interviewing staff at TK Maxx before being told over the radio they were in the wrong place.
CHIS – Covert Human Intelligence Source. Alternatively known in court as “an informant”. Known in common parlance as a “grass” or “snitch” who may eventually come to a violent end. Hence the phrase “snitches get stitches”.
POLAC – Police Accident. Usually a road accident involving a police vehicle. This will inevitably lead to the aforementioned driver having to purchase a large quantity of cakes for his laughing colleagues back at the station. (“Sorry Sarge, I think I may have reversed the riot van into your new Audi”)
OIC – Officer In Case (“Right, Constable Crap-driver, you’re now the OIC on this abducted-by-alien complaint”)
SIO – Senior Investigating Officer
POLSA – Police Search Advisor – a specially-trained officer who advises on the best approach to carry out searches in Misper cases or suspected murders where bodies are yet to be found.
Code 11 – Off duty (“Sorry Sarge, I can’t attend that alien abduction, I’m Code 11 as of 10 minutes ago”)
ASNT – Area Search No Trace. When police have searched area for a suspect but there’s no trace of them.
DL – Driving Licence (“Sarge, got a little green man here with what looks like a dodgy DL”)
Code 4 – a meal break. (“Can someone else go to that Sarge, I’m Code 4?”)
RJ - Restorative Justice. (“Well Sarge, could he at least repaint the fence he’s drawn a k**b on? The victim is okay with some RJ”)
CIM - Critical Incident Manager. Invariably an Inspector rank officer who oversees all the live “critical” incidents going on in the area and makes the decisions which ensure these situations don’t get any worse.
NFP – Normal For Plymouth (“Sarge, we found the naked bloke wearing a tutu, off his head on mushrooms and mumbling something about ‘Green Army’.” “Yes lad, that’s NFP”.)
(Image: Carl Eve)
NFA – No Further Action. When police either cannot get the evidence to convince the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) to go for a charge, the case is dropped and the person is told there will be NFA
RUI – Released Under Investigation. Since bail has been hurled out the door by the Government, people are told they are not on bail, but they are RUI and can be arrested at any moment as inquiries continue. This has been sold to the public by the Government as a good thing. No-one in the police thinks it is a good thing.
NPAS – National Police Air Service. As part of a cost-cutting exercise police helicopters were taken out of police force’s control and a single body was created to cover the country.
FPN – Fixed Penalty Notice. Effectively a fine handed to you by police
AIO – All In Order (“Sarge, I’ve check the house where the Demis Roussos was being played louder than a jet engine. It’s AIO”)
WOA – Words Of Advice (“Sarge, we pulled the driver over who had a cow in the back seat of his Land Rover and, as it’s NFP we’ve given him WOA”)
(Image: Jon Bishop)
UNIFI – Unified Police Intelligence. The police’s crime, intelligence and custody computer database. It sends officers mad trying to get it to work. Imagine Windows 89 but on its last legs.
NOIP – Notice of Intended Prosecution. Effectively a note which tells you your future may well involve a court visit.
SOCA – Serious and Organised Crime. As opposed to Jocular and Erratic Crime. This is the environment where you encounter men called Dave with broken noses and leather jackets who keep money in large rolls, run a scrap metal merchants and can get you a shooter to go with a kilo of coke.
SOCIT – Serious and Organised Crime Investigation Team. Where Detectives go when they want to be their childhood heroes, Bodie and Doyle.
SOCO – Scene of Crime Officer (“Sarge, can you get CIS down here for forensics?” “No Constable Savage, this isn’t CSI Miami - in Plymouth we call them SOCOs”)
SODAIT – Sexual Offences and Domestic Abuse Investigation Team.

(“Sorry Sarge, I think I may have reversed the riot van into your new Audi”)
OIC – Officer In Case (“Right, Constable Crap-driver, you’re now the OIC on this abducted-by-alien complaint”)
SIO – Senior Investigating Officer
POLSA – Police Search Advisor – a specially-trained officer who advises on the best approach to carry out searches in Misper cases or suspected murders where bodies are yet to be found.
Code 11 – Off duty (“Sorry Sarge, I can’t attend that alien abduction, I’m Code 11 as of 10 minutes ago”)
ASNT – Area Search No Trace. When police have searched area for a suspect but there’s no trace of them.
DL – Driving Licence (“Sarge, got a little green man here with what looks like a dodgy DL”)
Code 4 – a meal break. (“Can someone else go to that Sarge, I’m Code 4?”)
RJ - Restorative Justice. (“Well Sarge, could he at least repaint the fence he’s drawn a k**b on? The victim is okay with some RJ”)
CIM - Critical Incident Manager. Invariably an Inspector rank officer who oversees all the live “critical” incidents going on in the area and makes the decisions which ensure these situations don’t get any worse.
NFP – Normal For Plymouth (“Sarge, we found the naked bloke wearing a tutu, off his head on mushrooms and mumbling something about ‘Green Army’.” “Yes lad, that’s NFP”.)
(Image: Carl Eve)
NFA – No Further Action. When police either cannot get the evidence to convince the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) to go for a charge, the case is dropped and the person is told there will be NFA
RUI – Released Under Investigation. Since bail has been hurled out the door by the Government, people are told they are not on bail, but they are RUI and can be arrested at any moment as inquiries continue. This has been sold to the public by the Government as a good thing. No-one in the police thinks it is a good thing.
NPAS – National Police Air Service. As part of a cost-cutting exercise police helicopters were taken out of police force’s control and a single body was created to cover the country.
FPN – Fixed Penalty Notice. Effectively a fine handed to you by police
AIO – All In Order (“Sarge, I’ve check the house where the Demis Roussos was being played louder than a jet engine. It’s AIO”)

(Image: Jon Bishop)
UNIFI – Unified Police Intelligence. The police’s crime, intelligence and custody computer database. It sends officers mad trying to get it to work. Imagine Windows 89 but on its last legs.
NOIP – Notice of Intended Prosecution. Effectively a note which tells you your future may well involve a court visit.

SOCIT – Serious and Organised Crime Investigation Team. Where Detectives go when they want to be their childhood heroes, Bodie and Doyle.
SOCO – Scene of Crime Officer (“Sarge, can you get CIS down here for forensics?” “No Constable Savage, this isn’t CSI Miami - in Plymouth we call them SOCOs”)
SODAIT – Sexual Offences and Domestic Abuse Investigation Team.

SOPO – Sex Offenders Prevention Order. An order by the court which attempts to keep sex offenders from committing sex offences. Considered by many Plymouth people to be less effective than a cigar cutter.
SOR – Sex Offenders Register. You can end up on this list from doing everything from patting a person of the opposite sex on the bottom against their wishes to the serial rape of children.

ABE – Achieving Best Evidence. Where victims of serious sexual assaults are video interviewed for their very first statement, which can then be used in court.
BCU – Basic Command Unit is the largest unit into which territorial British Police forces are divided. Plymouth is populated enough to be an entire BCU. Remarkably, the entire county of Cornwall is just one BCU. In the same way that it’s one sandwich short of a picnic.

Big Red Key – battering ram for smashing down doors. It’s big. It’s red. It opens doors.
(Image: Carl Eve)
OT – Overtime (“Sarge, will I be getting any OT for this?”)

Of course occasionally unexpected phrases can turn up in the most unlikely of places:
For many years Charles Cross police station went under the code “EC” while Crownhill had the code EL which stems from the old alpha area codes with Plymouth being the E division and the next letter being the first or last letter of the station.
However, a few years back it was decided to change all the codes, such as the Criminal Investigation Department which went by the well-known name CID. That became the Local Investigation Team - a LIT. And thus Charles Cross unexpectedly enjoyed having its very own CLIT.
Female detectives at that department remarked that on the first day of the changeover, none of the male officers turned up for work in the office because they couldn’t find it.
The fun stuff
While the official list of acronyms runs to an entire booklet with more than 300 terms, there are some acronyms and policing phrases which have eased their way into common police parlance and very few of them are half as polite or politically correct. However, we must keep in mind, policing can be a dark job on occasions and dark humour grows in such places.
FUBAR BUNDY – F***** Up Beyond Any Recovery But Unfortunately Not Dead Yet. (“Sarge, that scrote who’s been battering old ladies and mugging them has come off his stolen scooter. He’s FUBAR BUNDY.”)
Code Brown – A close shave. (“Sarge, Sarge, that concrete block thrown from the multi-story just missed my head. I’m proper Code Brown here Sarge!”)
Jeremy Kyle referral – A person of the like one would expect to appear on a popular daytime TV show where various wastrels, ne’er do wells and vagabonds are given DNA checks but not dental treatment.
GTP – Good To Police. A sympathetic or welcoming shop/café/organisation/resident. Such as a resident who offers a cup of tea to officers who are on scene guard in the pouring rain.
Furry Exocet – a Police Dog (see also, Land Shark and Hairy Exocet)
ATNS – like ASNT, but it’s where the likelihood of anyone being around is less than zero, so Area Traced, No Search.
Gidgy – A deployment considered by officers to be a “piece of p***”. A job where there is the pretence of working, but being able to do so without to actually do anything. A bit like SPLB duty – Shuffle Paper, Look Busy.
BINGO seat – Bollocks I’m Not Getting Out seat. The back seat in the PSU carrier.
BONGO – Books On, Never Goes Out. A lazy cop.
LOB – Load of Bollocks. Often used when describing a false or grossly exaggerated call from a MOP - Member of Public. (“Sarge, you were asking about that kidnap, serial killer, alien invasion job… it’s a LOB, close the log.”)
GDP or WDP – Greater Dorset Police or West Dorset Police. A term used to describe Devon and Cornwall Police since so many of its departments have now been taken over by Dorset Police. A term often used by other neighbouring forces when they wish to chide, josh or ridicule Devon and Cornwall Police officers.
A Unit – A person who is considered quite muscular and may cause officers a little bit of trouble.
A Big Unit – A big person, who will definitely cause officers a bit of trouble if he chooses to.
FBU – F****** Big Unit. An awfully big person. (“Sarge, can we have a few more officers please. This bloke you’ve told us to arrest said he won’t come out of the pub and he’s an FBU”)
DODI – Dead One Did It. Used in reference to single vehicle fatal RTCs where there is only one occupant of the vehicle in question.
DILLIGAF – Do I Look Like I Give A F***? A response offered when a MOP indignantly asks for the officer’s name. (“Certainly Sir, I’m Sgt Dilligaf, now would you please blow into this bag. No, this one, not that second one you can see…”)
FLUB – F***ing Lazy Useless B***ard. A term used out of earshot for a very disagreeable and inept officer, who is also possibly corrupt.
NFI – No F***ing Interest (“Sarge, I’ve spoken to the neighbours about it and they’ve NFI”)

RAT- Really Adept at Traffic Law (“Sarge, I’ve got a RAT here who’s convinced driving at 60mph in a 30mph is a Human Right”.)
The final synonym offered to Plymouth Live from an anonymous source was: “When asked for directions, you point at the hat and cap badge and advise them “It says E II R, not A to Z”.
There’s probably hundreds of others, both legitimate and illegitimate. Tell us any you’ve heard.

"Questions raised over suitability of proposed new graveyard in Crews Hill, reports Simon Allin, Local Democracy Reporter

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

She pointed out Sloemans Farm was ranked third by the council on a list of suitable sites for a new cemetery and said the civic centre should have considered locations outside the borough.

The Tory leader also raised concerns over transport. She said getting to the cemetery would involve a “long walk” down Whitewebbs Lane, which does not have enough street lighting, and the council would have to spend “millions” adding pavements to the road.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

Responding to the comments, council leader Nesil Caliskan said assessments had shown there was a “real need” for burial space in Enfield, and some groups, including the Muslim community, had said it was difficult to find burial space.

She accepted Sloemans Farm had been rated third by the council but pointed out the other two locations were being used for agriculture, so on balance it was “the appropriate site”.

Cllr Caliskan agreed with the transport concerns and said these would be addressed through the planning process. She said the council had asked Transport for London to provide a bus stop nearby, which the civic centre would consider financing.

The council leader also said that using Sloemans Farm as a cemetery would “negate considerably” the possibility that part of Firs Farm Recreation Ground, in Winchmore Hill, would be used as a crematorium. Land earmarked for recreational use at the site was identified as suitable for a crematorium in the council’s draft Local Plan, sparking a backlash from residents.

But Conservative committee member James Hockney pointed out that burial use and a crematorium are not the same, and said he could not understand why they had been conflated.

Cllr Caliskan responded that they are both classed as “after life provision”, and claimed a cemetery at Sloemans Farm “negates the need for other after life provision”.

Labour’s Birsen Demirel argued in favour of providing a cemetery in the borough rather than elsewhere. She said: “If we can provide in the borough […] why should we consider burying our loved ones far away from where we live?”

In response to transport concerns, Derek Levy, of opposition group Community First, suggested using income from the cemetery to fund a shuttle bus service from Enfield Town to the site.

After the debate, Conservative committee members Peter Fallart and Cllr Hockney voted to send the decision back to cabinet for further consideration.

Hertford Road Cemetery is among the existing graveyards in Enfield, but the council is rapidly running out of burial space

A farm within Enfield’s Green Belt is the best site for a new cemetery needed to deal with a borough-wide shortage of burial space, council chiefs have insisted.

Officers and members of the Labour administration defended plans for the cemetery in Sloemans Farm, Whitewebbs Road – a 23-hectare site that will provide space for 38,000 single graves.

Cabinet members agreed the scheme on 13th October. But members of the Conservative group subsequently ‘called in’ the decision to the overview and scrutiny committee, raising concerns over the Crews Hill site’s suitability, including a lack of transport links.

Following a debate on Wednesday, the scrutiny committee voted to confirm the cabinet decision, meaning the scheme can go ahead if it is granted planning permission.

Conservative leader Joanne Laban told the scrutiny meeting she thought the decision to use the Sloemans Farm site was “more to do with income than [burial] provision”. The site could generate £1.4million for the council, according to the cabinet report.

"SICKNESS rates among NHS staff have almost doubled in a year - amid talk of ‘burnout’ forcing retirement due to the pandemic - according to concerning new figures.

The report from NHS Digital reveals that in December, the sickness absence rate among staff working across Barnsley’s Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) - which plans and monitors frontline healthcare services in the borough - was 2.85 per cent of the 144 staff employed.

Those roles include professionally qualified clinical staff, hospital and community health service doctors, nurses, therapeutic staff, infrastructure and management.

A year prior, in December 2020, the absence rate was 1.57 per cent, and the latest figure is the highest in two years since December 2019’s 2.91 per cent.

Staffing levels at Barnsley CCG have fallen through the last year, from 154 in March, but have otherwise been on an upward trend since 2013.

The figures show Barnsley Hospital’s rate is also the highest in almost a year, at 6.28 per cent of 4,066 staff.

Senior councillors on Barnsley Council’s overview and scrutiny committee discussed a wide-ranging report on a recently-established ‘place-based partnership’ last week which sets out the scale of issues facing services in the borough.

One of the most discussed issues affecting the care sector has been staffing - both retention and recruitment - which has caused knock-on effects, particularly to local mental health services.

The report said ‘close monitoring’ of staff was ongoing to understand their health and wellbeing needs, but that it was ‘important’ to continue paying attention to these amid the move to the new model.

“There are high levels of staff absence due to Covid and infection prevention and control measures continue to put additional strain on the workforce and estate,” it said.

“Employers across our health and care system are seeing higher levels of burnout and more colleagues accessing support services but more still who would benefit.

“Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and South West Yorkshire Partnership Foundation Trust (SWYPFT) have reported higher numbers of staff retiring in the latter part of 2021/22.

“In some cases, these are colleagues who have delayed retirement to support the pandemic response, but some retirements are reportedly because of burnout.

“Through the next stage it is important that organisations pay attention to how people are feeling, recovering, and responding to the next set of challenges.

“Close monitoring of staff turnover is taking place to develop appropriate plans to support retention and recruitment of staff and already positive work has taken place to support staff’s health and wellbeing including better access to support including counsellors.”

The CCG is set to be ‘abolished’ under ambitious new plans to create integrated health and social care in Barnsley.

The new partnership - between Barnsley CCG, the council, NHS trusts, and voluntary services including Barnsley Hospice - will usher in a new statutory Integrated Care Board (ICB) in July and then a further Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) aimed at addressing ‘wider health, public health, and social care needs’ in September.",ID_67,Barnsley,Barnsley; Cotswold; Shropshire,Barnsley,barnsleychronicle.com,article-1524064
"School leaders are under pressure to reverse their decision to close a week early for Christmas.
The government has been in talks with Focus Trust after it announced last week that all 15 of its schools - seven of which are in our region - will close on December 11, instead of the original planned date of December 18.
Its decision came amid growing concerns over the number of families that could be forced to isolate over the festive period because of positive cases.
Families were initially told that during the week, pupils would be be expected to work from home - with teachers offering paper-based and online work for them to complete - but it will now be classed as a normal holiday.
Unlike the lockdown earlier this year, they will not be open to children of key workers or vulnerable youngsters.
Mum Cheryl Doyle, whose children go to Manor Green Primary Academy in Denton - one of the seven schools affected in Greater Manchester - said she would struggle to get childcare to cover the extra week off at short notice.

The Department for Education is not happy with the Trust's decision either and has asked bosses to review it.
School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said: “The best place for children to be is in schools, which is why it remains a national priority to keep them open full time and avoid further disruption to education.
“I know this is a challenging time but the latest data shows only 0.2% of pupils were off school isolating with a confirmed case of coronavirus. Closing early for Christmas or extending the holidays is not the answer.

What do you think about the schools closing a week earlier than planned for Christmas? Do you think others should follow suit? Would it leave you struggling for childcare? Let us know in the comments here or on our Manchester Family Facebook page.
“The Chief Medical Officer has been clear that schools should remain open and has highlighted the damage caused by not being in education to children’s education, development and mental health, which greatly outweighs any other risks. Children are at very low risk from the virus, and staff are not at higher risk than those working in other sectors.”
The schools closing a week early include:
Manor Green Primary Academy, Denton, Tameside
Old Trafford Community Academy, Trafford
Freehold Community Primary, Oldham
Lyndhurst Primary, Oldham
Coppice Primary Academy, Oldham
Roundthorn Primary Academy, Oldham
Deeplish Primary Academy, Rochdale

Cheryl, who works as an A&E nurse, is hoping the Trust responds to the government and reverts back to the original closure date.
She said: ""We had a letter stating the extra week is now a holiday and the children will not be expected to do any work, which is better, but it still doesn’t help with the last minute childcare issues a lot of us working parents will have.
""I understand why they are doing it but I think it’s unnecessary. The original finish date would be better for everyone because it is just so last minute. As it stands I might have to have last minute emergency time off work and as a nurse this is not professional or helpful at this current time.""
Focus Trust’s chief executive Helen Rowland said last week that they 'recognise the short notice may be an issue for some families' but want to 'ensure that no one is forced to self-isolate over the holiday because of someone they have come into contact with at school'.
The Manchester Evening News has approached Focus Trust for a further comment about the talks with government.

"Sebastian Marciniak, who is based in Orford, is part of the Polish community in Warrington doing their best to support Ukrainians in need.

He saw two girls on a Polish Facebook group looking for space to house donations and Sebastian could provide this at SMR Motorsport.

The 33-year-old, who moved from Poland in 2008, said: “I think it’s a human right to help and I like to help.

“I was watching the news and I said to my partner, we have to help and we have to do something.

“I put it in Polish and my friend Jeff wrote it down in English and the message was shared far and wide.

“I have had lots of calls and people have been bringing everything. I didn’t think we would get this many calls.

“As much as we can, we will help. I can’t imagine what I would do in that situation.

“It’s not our war but you still have to help.

“We are collecting until Thursday and I know it's short notice but if we need more items and it goes on for longer, we can expand that.”

Sebastian said he will help as much as he can

They will not be collecting more clothes and instead ask for the likes of toiletries, blankets, toys and everyday essentials.

Sebastian is collecting from his other work and his partner is collecting from her work to add to the effort.

His friend, Jeff Leake from Arnway Limited at the industrial centre saw Sebastian’s post and he has the vehicles to move items.

“As good as these major charities are and as big as they are, it can be quite hard for them to switch direction and divert from one disaster to another.

“We just want to be a part of something that is fast, reactive and gets stuff going.”

The 29-year-old continued: “People from all walks of life are helping from CEOs to people that don’t earn a lot of money – people are doing what they can to help.

“A little bit or a lot, people are doing what they can. Anything is better than sitting back and watching it happen.

“Around 95 per cent of this effort has come from the Polish community in Warrington and they know what life is like in that area.

“We’re not calling ourselves saviours but we have the space and the gear to move it around, it all amounts up.

"The Next-door Nature project is a new natural legacy to mark the Queen’s Jubilee, and it will help nature flourish in Montgomeryshire.The National Lottery Heritage Fund today announced a £5million investment in a ground-breaking initiative to create a huge matrix of community-led naturalising projects – improving the lives of people from some of the most disadvantaged areas across the UK and leaving a lasting natural legacy in honour of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, according to organisers.Delivered by Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, Nextdoor Nature will give people the skills, tools, and opportunity to take action for nature. This could include establishing wild habitats and green corridors in areas of economic and nature deprivation or naturalising school grounds or unused areas. The pandemic has demonstrated just how important access to a well-cared for natural environment is to communities across the UK.Kirsty Martuccio, Team Wilder Officer at Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said: “This is a really exciting and valuable project, enabling communities suffering with rural deprivation and social isolation to take action to improve natural spaces on their doorstep.""We will inspire and up-skill individuals, and support community projects, to bring back nature and make a tangible change. Communities will be empowered to continue the work within their own groups and organisations, leaving a legacy that lasts long beyond the programme.”Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust will support various new groups over the next two years, working with communities who need help identifying and developing their local green spaces, to benefit individuals and groups within their community.Evidence shows that people are increasingly disconnected from nature, with profound consequences for health and it also means they are less likely to protect their natural heritage.",ID_77,Montgomeryshire,Powys; Shropshire,Powys,mynewtown.co.uk,article-1792890

"The annual ceremony is held at the Crookston War Memorial at St Michael’s Parish Church, Inveresk.

It will get under way at 1.30am, with Alister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, reading out the names of the fallen.

Andrew Agnew, pastor at the Wallyford Livingroom Church, will recite the poem In Flanders Fields before wreaths are laid at the memorial.

The hymn Abide With Me will be sung and The Last Post played on the bugle by Simon Lowden, from Wallyford, before Musselburgh Sea Cadets will lower the colours, followed by a two-minute silence at 11am.

The Reveille will be sounded and Jim McLean, a member of Wallyford Community Council, has arranged for Battle’s Over to be played on the sound system. Gordon Steven, deacon at St Clement’s Church in Wallyford, will give a Christian message.

Mr Hadden will then read out the Kohima Epitaph, which is carved on the memorial of the 2nd British Division in the cemetery of Kohima in north-east India. The service will end with the national anthem.

A service will also take place at St Clement’s Church in Wallyford on Remembrance Sunday, November 14, at 10am.

Wreaths will be laid in the church garden at 11am as a piper plays a musical tribute.

The Crookston Memorial was produced by local man Mr Carrick, is composed of red sandstone and stands nearly six feet high, with two reversed rifles and a wreath of laurels engraved at the top.

In the centre, a panel bears the names and regiments of those who were killed in the Great War of 1914-18.

Following the conflict, the communities of Wallyford, Smeaton and Deantown (now Whitecraig) decided to honour the men who fell with a memorial. They chose to erect the memorial at Crookston School, between and serving all the villages. It was unveiled on September 13, 1919, by Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Hope.

More than 100 former pupils had answered the call of duty and the names of 20 of them appeared on the memorial.

When Crookston School closed in about 1958, the memorial was taken to Inveresk Cemetery.

In 2014, Wallyford Community Council secured funding from the Centenary Memorials Restoration Fund, administered by the War Memorials Trust, along with funding from East Lothian Council’s Civic Pride Fund, to have restoration work carried out on the memorial stone.",ID_71,Inveresk,East Lothian,East Lothian,eastlothiancourier.com,article-1841911

A top TV comic will take to the stage for a special 'one night only' show for charity next month.
Kiri Pritchard-McLean will headline a special night of stand-up at Bangor's Pontio Arts Centre in January.
The Have I Got News For You and 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown star will join a host of other top comics for the event which will raise money in aid of North Wales charity GISDA.

All proceeds will help fund ongoing LGBT+ programmes organised by the charity.
Born in Gloucester but raised on Anglesey, McLean has won a number of awards for her stand-up comedy and has racked-up a variety of TV guest appearances in recent years - including stints on BBC's Would I Lie to You? alongside David Mitchell and Jo Brand and the smash hit Live at the Apollo stand-up series on Comedy Central.
This will be the second time that McLean has performed a charity show in aid of GISDA.
The latest stand-up show - called GISDA Giggles 2.0 - comes hot on the heels of an identical event which took place in 2020.
It saw Pritchard-McLean and a number of other comics perform in front of a sell-out crowd at Pontio.

McLean said: ""It’s an absolute pleasure and delight to be hosting GISDA Giggles again.
""Everyone in the audience is going to have a top notch night of comedy knowing their ticket money is going to a great cause.
""Once again North Wales gets to show the world that love is love and we’re a place of tolerance and acceptance and that’s why I’m so proud to be from here.""
Launched in 1989, GISDA is a charity which helps young people who are affected by a variety of different challenges - including poverty and homelessness.
Since its inception in the 1980s, the organisation has grown and currently has a number of different branches dotted around Gwynedd.
In 2017, GISDA launched a youth club to give young members of the LGTB+ community in Gwynedd the chance to meet, socialise and support each other.
The stellar line-up for GISDA Giggles 2.0 will include also performances by comics Suzi Ruffell, Josh Jones, Maggi Noggi, Ben Hodge, Sikisa Bostwick Barnes and Leila Navabi.
GISDA volunteer Klaire Hodgson, who helped organise the event, said: ""The first GISDA Giggles made such a positive impact on our LGBT+ youth club and young people's lives.
""Personally, I don't think it would have been possible to be where we are today without GISDA Giggles and I can't thank everyone enough for their support.
""As a volunteer, I've seen our members grow with confidence, become proud of who they are and move on to achieve great things.
""Life is hard enough on young people right now without the family problems and homophobia which can come with being part of the LGBT+ community - it can have a detrimental effect on a young person's mental health and that's why it's so important to keep these services available.
""I can't wait for GISDA Giggles 2.0!
""Kiri has planned and arranged a fantastic night with a stellar line up that will split your sides with laughter and it's happening right here in North Wales.""
GISDA Giggles 2.0 takes place at Pontio, Bangor on January 15 2022.

""As a volunteer, I've seen our members grow with confidence, become proud of who they are and move on to achieve great things.
""Life is hard enough on young people right now without the family problems and homophobia which can come with being part of the LGBT+ community - it can have a detrimental effect on a young person's mental health and that's why it's so important to keep these services available.

This will be the second time that McLean has performed a charity show in aid of GISDA.
The latest stand-up show - called GISDA Giggles 2.0 - comes hot on the heels of an identical event which took place in 2020.

McLean said: ""It’s an absolute pleasure and delight to be hosting GISDA Giggles again.
""Everyone in the audience is going to have a top notch night of comedy knowing their ticket money is going to a great cause.
""Once again North Wales gets to show the world that love is love and we’re a place of tolerance and acceptance and that’s why I’m so proud to be from here.""
Launched in 1989, GISDA is a charity which helps young people who are affected by a variety of different challenges - including poverty and homelessness.
Since its inception in the 1980s, the organisation has grown and currently has a number of different branches dotted around Gwynedd.
In 2017, GISDA launched a youth club to give young members of the LGTB+ community in Gwynedd the chance to meet, socialise and support each other.
The stellar line-up for GISDA Giggles 2.0 will include also performances by comics Suzi Ruffell, Josh Jones, Maggi Noggi, Ben Hodge, Sikisa Bostwick Barnes and Leila Navabi.

On March 25, 2021, the 33-year-old was lured to the canalside in Leigh by three callous teenagers who would go on to stab him 35 times before chucking him into the water to die. Video footage, which formed part of Greater Manchester Police’s investigation, showed Liam Bailey, 19, Harry Maher, 16, and Liam O’Brien, 17, leading Mr Anderton to a secluded stretch of the canal, off King Street.

The trio were all jailed for their roles in the brutal killing after a five week trial at Manchester Crown Court in November 2021.

Scott Anderton

Bailey, of Diamond Street, Leigh, was sentenced to life in custody with a minimum term of 23 years and four months. Maher, of Green Lane, Standish, was also jailed for life and must serve at least 16 years before he is eligible for parole.

O’Brien, of Schofield Street, Leigh, was ordered to serve 10 years in prison.

For Cllr Kevin Anderson, portfolio holder for Police, Crime and Civil Contingencies, this CCTV funding commitment is a ‘personal victory’. The funding will go towards increasing the number of cameras and improving the imagery.

“We hope with the investment it makes people feel safer,” Coun Anderson said. “For me the murder stuck in my mind to show the importance of good CCTV and how it can help – and we got the convictions at Manchester Crown Court as a result.

“CCTV acts as more of a deterrent and a warning for those doing things against the law – we’ve had a difficult period of time with the pandemic. There seems to have been a rise in terms of aggressive behaviour and letting off steam and that can boil over to something worse.”

Since 2019, there have been 118 extra CCTV cameras installed across the borough, with 52 of those coming to Leigh. A further 25 were installed in Platt Bridge, five at Chapel Lane Car Park, 30 on Standishgate in the town centre and six at Haigh Hall.

The council also issued 31 Rapid Deployment Cameras in this time. This was to support teams fighting antisocial behaviour and fly tipping.

“Our CCTV network has undergone a major expansion as part of our multi-agency approach to preventing crime and anti-social behaviour across Wigan Borough,” Coun Anderson continued. “Most recently the council invested almost £500,000 into our CCTV network, with £56,000 going on improving the network in Platt Bridge and a further £420,000 earmarked for new and upgraded cameras in Wigan, Leigh, Ashton and Pemberton.

“State-of-the-art CCTV cameras have also been placed at well-known fly tip hotspots, including in Ince, Platt Bridge, Hindley. Last year Leigh West was also awarded a share of the Safer Streets Fund and additional CCTV cameras were a key part of this £500,000 scheme.

“The expansion of our CCTV network will continue following our latest successful bid to the Safer Streets Fund which awarded the council with almost £750,000 to improve safety and deter anti-social behaviour in Platt Bridge and Scholes. This investment is in addition to many great initiatives being overseen by the Place and Community Safety Partnership, which aims to ensure Wigan Borough is a safe place to live and work for us all.”

This commitment to night time safety was something that helped get Wigan town centre Purple Flag Status. This is the recognition of excellence in the evening and night-time economy – a place that is diverse, vibrant, safe, attractive and welcoming.

In addition to this commitment, Coun Anderson is excited about the relaunch of the neighbourhood watch initiative across the borough in order to increase public involvement in preventing crime.

On March 25, 2021, the 33-year-old was lured to the canalside in Leigh by three callous teenagers who would go on to stab him 35 times before chucking him into the water to die. Video footage, which formed part of Greater Manchester Police’s investigation, showed Liam Bailey, 19, Harry Maher, 16, and Liam O’Brien, 17, leading Mr Anderton to a secluded stretch of the canal, off King Street.

The trio were all jailed for their roles in the brutal killing after a five week trial at Manchester Crown Court in November 2021.

Scott Anderton

Bailey, of Diamond Street, Leigh, was sentenced to life in custody with a minimum term of 23 years and four months. Maher, of Green Lane, Standish, was also jailed for life and must serve at least 16 years before he is eligible for parole.

O’Brien, of Schofield Street, Leigh, was ordered to serve 10 years in prison.

For Cllr Kevin Anderson, portfolio holder for Police, Crime and Civil Contingencies, this CCTV funding commitment is a ‘personal victory’. The funding will go towards increasing the number of cameras and improving the imagery.

“We hope with the investment it makes people feel safer,” Coun Anderson said. “For me the murder stuck in my mind to show the importance of good CCTV and how it can help – and we got the convictions at Manchester Crown Court as a result.

“CCTV acts as more of a deterrent and a warning for those doing things against the law – we’ve had a difficult period of time with the pandemic. There seems to have been a rise in terms of aggressive behaviour and letting off steam and that can boil over to something worse.”

Since 2019, there have been 118 extra CCTV cameras installed across the borough, with 52 of those coming to Leigh. A further 25 were installed in Platt Bridge, five at Chapel Lane Car Park, 30 on Standishgate in the town centre and six at Haigh Hall.

The council also issued 31 Rapid Deployment Cameras in this time. This was to support teams fighting antisocial behaviour and fly tipping.

“Our CCTV network has undergone a major expansion as part of our multi-agency approach to preventing crime and anti-social behaviour across Wigan Borough,” Coun Anderson continued. “Most recently the council invested almost £500,000 into our CCTV network, with £56,000 going on improving the network in Platt Bridge and a further £420,000 earmarked for new and upgraded cameras in Wigan, Leigh, Ashton and Pemberton.

“State-of-the-art CCTV cameras have also been placed at well-known fly tip hotspots, including in Ince, Platt Bridge, Hindley. Last year Leigh West was also awarded a share of the Safer Streets Fund and additional CCTV cameras were a key part of this £500,000 scheme.

“The expansion of our CCTV network will continue following our latest successful bid to the Safer Streets Fund which awarded the council with almost £750,000 to improve safety and deter anti-social behaviour in Platt Bridge and Scholes. This investment is in addition to many great initiatives being overseen by the Place and Community Safety Partnership, which aims to ensure Wigan Borough is a safe place to live and work for us all.”

This commitment to night time safety was something that helped get Wigan town centre Purple Flag Status. This is the recognition of excellence in the evening and night-time economy – a place that is diverse, vibrant, safe, attractive and welcoming.

In addition to this commitment, Coun Anderson is excited about the relaunch of the neighbourhood watch initiative across the borough in order to increase public involvement in preventing crime. It is hoped this will improve public engagement with police and appeals to help solve crimes.",ID_74,Platt Bridge,Wigan,Bolton,theboltonnews.co.uk,article-1876242

This commitment to night time safety was something that helped get Wigan town centre Purple Flag Status. This is the recognition of excellence in the evening and night-time economy – a place that is diverse, vibrant, safe, attractive and welcoming.

In addition to this commitment, Coun Anderson is excited about the relaunch of the neighbourhood watch initiative across the borough in order to increase public involvement in preventing crime.

"The council has put in almost £500,000 into this security system which was an important factor in catching the killers of Scott Anderton last year.

On March 25, 2021, the 33-year-old was lured to the canalside in Leigh by three callous teenagers who would go on to stab him 35 times before chucking him into the water to die. Video footage, which formed part of Greater Manchester Police’s investigation, showed Liam Bailey, 19, Harry Maher, 16, and Liam O’Brien, 17, leading Mr Anderton to a secluded stretch of the canal, off King Street.

The trio were all jailed for their roles in the brutal killing after a five week trial at Manchester Crown Court in November 2021.

Scott Anderton

Bailey, of Diamond Street, Leigh, was sentenced to life in custody with a minimum term of 23 years and four months. Maher, of Green Lane, Standish, was also jailed for life and must serve at least 16 years before he is eligible for parole.

O’Brien, of Schofield Street, Leigh, was ordered to serve 10 years in prison.

For Cllr Kevin Anderson, portfolio holder for Police, Crime and Civil Contingencies, this CCTV funding commitment is a ‘personal victory’. The funding will go towards increasing the number of cameras and improving the imagery.

“We hope with the investment it makes people feel safer,” Coun Anderson said. “For me the murder stuck in my mind to show the importance of good CCTV and how it can help – and we got the convictions at Manchester Crown Court as a result.

“CCTV acts as more of a deterrent and a warning for those doing things against the law – we’ve had a difficult period of time with the pandemic. There seems to have been a rise in terms of aggressive behaviour and letting off steam and that can boil over to something worse.”

Since 2019, there have been 118 extra CCTV cameras installed across the borough, with 52 of those coming to Leigh. A further 25 were installed in Platt Bridge, five at Chapel Lane Car Park, 30 on Standishgate in the town centre and six at Haigh Hall.

The council also issued 31 Rapid Deployment Cameras in this time. This was to support teams fighting antisocial behaviour and fly tipping.

“Our CCTV network has undergone a major expansion as part of our multi-agency approach to preventing crime and anti-social behaviour across Wigan Borough,” Coun Anderson continued. “Most recently the council invested almost £500,000 into our CCTV network, with £56,000 going on improving the network in Platt Bridge and a further £420,000 earmarked for new and upgraded cameras in Wigan, Leigh, Ashton and Pemberton.

“State-of-the-art CCTV cameras have also been placed at well-known fly tip hotspots, including in Ince, Platt Bridge, Hindley. Last year Leigh West was also awarded a share of the Safer Streets Fund and additional CCTV cameras were a key part of this £500,000 scheme.

“The expansion of our CCTV network will continue following our latest successful bid to the Safer Streets Fund which awarded the council with almost £750,000 to improve safety and deter anti-social behaviour in Platt Bridge and Scholes. This investment is in addition to many great initiatives being overseen by the Place and Community Safety Partnership, which aims to ensure Wigan Borough is a safe place to live and work for us all.”

"The council held three online sessions focusing on community needs, connectivity, sustainability, and the environment to gather views from locals on the South West Maidenhead site, which is earmarked for 2,600 homes, with 30 per cent affordable housing, primary and secondary schools, a local centre, employment space, and green space.

This will help inform the site-specific supplementary planning document (SPD) to provide further guidance and information on planning applications.

The site, which is allocated within the now adopted borough local plan, compromises the Maidenhead golf course, land south of Harvest Hill Road, the Triangle site – which is land south of the A308(M) – and Braywick Park, which is earmarked to be a public park, a special needs school, a wildlife zone, and sports hub.

On April 6, the second session focused on connectivity. It looked at how the proposed sites will connect with each other and with the town to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport rather than occupiers being too reliant on the private car.

Ian Manktelow, principal planning policy officer, said they are currently looking at adding a bridge from the housing site to the triangle, which is earmarked for employment, and vice versa for residents to safely cross over the A308(M).

He said: “We’re doing some more work on that at the moment to generally look at the feasibility and desirability of that whether that is the best option or whether the other options that might be better from the point of view of ensuring particularly that the employment site is well connected into other parts of the town.

“That’s some work we want to complete before we publish the draft SPD in the summer.”

Within the housing site, a ‘north-south green spine’ will be added in the middle of the site to provide a link to the town centre and on-site facilities to not only encourage more walking and cycling but also create different types of open spaces along its length.

Mr Manktelow also said new wildlife connections could also be created.

A new east-west corridor on Harvest Hill Road could cut through the housing site to promote further ‘behavioural change’ to walking and cycling.

In addition, the council is working on its local cycling and walking infrastructure plan that sets out plans to improve and add new effective routes in key areas across the Royal Borough, including in South West Maidenhead.

"The rapid result keyworker Covid test centre at the Polish Club in Melton EMN-210203-171207001

Alicia Kearns, who represents Rutland and Melton, said the spike in infections was isolated to just the town and there was no evidence to link it to children returning to schools in the last fortnight following a relaxing of some lockdown restrictions.

Resident aged under 40 are encouraged to get tested if they cannot work from home or are in regular contact with a child or young person in education, even if they do not have any symptoms of coronavirus.

Mrs Kearns said this morning (Friday): “It’s troubling to see an increase in cases in Melton Town but my message is simple: if you are under 40-years-old and can’t work from home, or have regular contact with children or young people in education, it is your duty to get tested.

“Even if you are not currently experiencing any symptoms of Covid-19 it’s quick and easy.”

Latest figures show there were 62 cases - an increase of 40 new cases - in the borough for the week to March 14.

Infection rate is 121 per 100,000 population compared to the England average of 45.

"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

"There is no institution quite like the great British boozer. In the UK, we love a good pint in our favourite pub's beer garden - and it's no different here in Hertfordshire.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

Many of us love flocking to our local for an ice cold beverage in the summer with our friends and family. And with Fathers Day just around the corner, many of us treating our dads to a pint or two.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in.

Whether you are looking for a quaint and cosy countryside pub or more of a glamorous spot which offers high-end food, there are plenty on offer here in Herts. But which pubs are the best in the county?

HertfordshireLive has compiled a list of 10 of the best pubs that we have here in our wonderful county. From famous award-winning pubs to the quieter, lesser known gems, there's a pub for everyone.

The Golden Lion, Hoddesdon

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated on the vibrant Hoddesdon High Street, the 'traditional' pub is full of history, being named as among the oldest pubs in the country, after being first established in 1535. The Golden Lion was originally a coaching inn and Henry VIII’s saddle was stored in the stables as he was said to have been forbidden from riding.

The staircase inside was used by 2nd class citizens if they were allowed in by the owners. History aside, the current pub offers a large South-West facing garden with a children’s play area and sheltered patio. A large parking area is available to the rear of the pub. Dogs and children are welcome all year round inside and out. The pub also offers a traditional Sunday lunch - perfect for treating your dad this Fathers Day.

Alford Arms, Frithsden

(Image: The Alford Arms)

Inside the Alford Arms’ cosy Victorian building you’ll find antique furniture, a darts board, background jazz and friendly staff. It is described as a ""pubby gem"" nestling in a secluded wooded valley.

The great Ashridge Forest is on its doorstep and the broad sweep of the Chiltern Hills is its backdrop. The food menu changes every week, making use of the very best of seasonal local produce.

There are over 20 gins to choose from, and the ales will more than likely be from local breweries including Tring, Rebellion, and Chiltern. They compliment the IPA and lager from Camden Town.

Bricklayers Arms, Flaunden

(Image: Google Maps)

Tucked away down winding lanes, this is a low brick and tiled pub which serves excellent meals. It's an 18th-century pub set in the rolling hills of the Chess Valley.

It has been owned by the same family for more than 18 years, and the head chef has won multiple awards. In summer, the terrace and beautifully kept old-fashioned garden have seats and tables.

College Arms, Hertford Heath

(Image: Trip Advisor)

According to the Good Pub Guide, this pub has ""hearty food, a good choice of drinks and numerous events throughout the year"". There is a wood-burning stove, an old brick fireplace long cushioned wall seats and pale leather dining chairs.

Their menu offers perfect pub grub: fish and chips, burgers, bubble and squeak and plenty of sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The College Arms has also won a Food and Wine Awards.

The Cricketers, Sarratt

(Image: Google Maps)

In the heart of Sarratt, the Cricketers overlooks the village green. It is everything you would expect of a quintessential English pub. Cricketing memorabilia hangs on the walls and there’s not one but two open fires - perfect in winter if not so much in summer.

It offers decent cask ales, a carefully chosen wine list, and a simple but tasty menu with fresh ingredients sourced locally wherever possible. The Cricketers have also won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine awards. Dogs are allowed in the bar.

The Duke of York, Barnet

(Image: The Duke of York)

Just on the border between Potters Bar and Barnet is the Duke of York Pub. They have a secluded, sprawling garden which is a real sun-trap on warm days and is very pretty with its flower beds and lawn. There’s also a play area for children.

The Duke of York’s menu includes classic British dishes complemented by more influences from other parts of the world, such as their sweet potato, aubergine and spinach Malaysian curry with coconut rice and pak choi.

Holly Bush, Potters Crouch

(Image: The Holly Bush)

This is an attractive, tranquil 17th-century pub tucked away in the idyllic hamlet of Potters Crouch near Chiswell Green. It has plenty of charming and quirky features.

There are antique dressers filled with plates, comfortably cushioned settles, a fox's mask, antlers, an old clock with a lovely chime, daily papers and a big fireplace.

The food includes sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy, smoked haddock fishcakes, sandwiches and platters, halloumi bites with sweet dipping sauce, smoked salmon with lemon crème fraîche, lamb koftas with tzatziki and more.

Prae Wood Arms, St Albans

(Image: Prae Wood Arms)

The Prae Wood Arms near St Albans was once a manor house, built in 1838 for Lady Frances Cooke Grimston. She referred to it as a ‘little cottage’, but we'd say that it's not quite an apt description for this large pub with a sprawling garden.

There’s a stone terrace overlooking the grass lawns which slope down to the River Ver. The interconnected bar and dining areas have antique-style dining chairs and tables of every size and shape.

Food includes hearty British classics including braised ox cheek pie as well as lighter sandwiches. Dogs are allowed in the bar. The Prae Wood Arms has also won the Good Pub Guide Beer and Wine Awards.

Red Lion, Preston

(Image: The Red Lion)

The Red Lion, in the village of Preston near Hitchin, became the first pub in the country to be owned by the local community in 1982. And they have never looked back.

It's a busy and cheerful place, with a freshly prepared and varied menu – much of it locally sourced. It includes sweet potato and spinach curry, prawns with garlic and chilli, wild mushroom, stilton and broccoli crumble, and so much more.

Furry friends are allowed in the bar. This boozer won a Good Pub Guide Beer and Price Awards in 2021.

The Waterside, Rickmansworth

(Image: Google Maps)

Situated near the stunning, serene settings of the River Colne, sits The Waterside pub in Rickmansworth. The 18th century pub also serves up homemade pies and fresh seafood alongside a substantial wine list. There is free car parking for customers and two gardens to relax in. The pub also offers highly-raved about Sunday lunches, perfect for that Fathers Day meal.

"There were welcome victories for all three of Fenland's senior teams in action this afternoon.

Wisbech Town are up to 17th in the Pitching In Northern Premier League Midland Division, four places off the bottom, after a 2-0 win at Daventry Town.

Toby Allen's fifth goal of the season gave the Fenmen a 14th minute lead and Liam Adams made it 2-0 in the first minute of the second half, thus securing Town's first league away win in nearly two years.

Toby Allen netted for Wisbech Town this afternoon

In the Thurlow Nunn Eastern Counties League Premier Division, it's now three league wins on the bounce for March Town, after losing their first five.

The Hares are up to 13th ahead of Tuesday night's trip to 18th placed Ely City, after thumping mid-table Kirkley and Pakefield 5-1. After scoring just one goal in the first seven games of the season, super striker Jack Friend netted four times to make it eight in his last four, and the impressive Jack Frohawk was also on target.

Parson Drove pulled off a great victory in the Thurlow Nunn Eastern Counties League First Division North, beating promotion-chasing Sheringham 1-0 at home. Drove's second win of the season lifts them up to 13th place, four points off the bottom. Ryan Lennon's fourth of the season secured the win.

Jack Friend netted four goals for March today

"Three boys have been arrested after a Blackpool teenager was violently assaulted and robbed in broad daylight.
The victim, aged 14, and two friends were approached by a group of several boys on Wednesday (April 14) at around 2.30pm down Dinmore Avenue.
It was then that he was punched to the floor before being kicked and his head stamped on.
A gold ring was stolen from the boy during the viscous incident.
The group attacking the 14-year-old ran from the scene, leaving the victim with head, face, and finger injuries.
Following enquiries from police on Thursday, three boys have been arrested in connection with the attack.
A 17-year-old boy and two boys aged 16, all from Blackpool, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been bailed to May 12.
Det Insp Abi Finch-Hall, of Blackpool CID: “This was a particularly shocking and violent robbery which we know has caused considerable anger and concern in the Grange Park community.
“We have made three arrests in connection with our investigation and are making further enquiries as part of the robbery to identify additional suspects.
“We realise people will have strong views on the attack and may seek forms of retribution – I would encourage people not to do this and to allow us to do our jobs and investigate the matter fully.
“We have increased patrols in the area and I want to reassure residents this is very much an ongoing investigation.
“If you have any information which can assist our enquiries please come forward and contact police in confidence.”

But the woman behind the mass memorial is furious because she says local parish councils and MK Council have refused to support the event, which is called Candleight4covid.

Deborah Lewis, who lost her dad to Covid last April, said: ""I have done my utmost to remain strictly non-political but, I can no longer sit back and let the sheer hypocrisy continue, especially from elected official in Milton Keynes who will shortly go to the polls claiming they care about their constituents.""

She approached MK Council and parish councils all over MK to ask for contributions towards the cost of the event, which will consist of a lantern parade followed by a ceremony in MK Rose on June 23.

Deborah's mum and dad died within six months of each other

The cash was needed to pay for public liability insurance, staging, lighting, and sound, a wet weather shelter and seating for dignitaries and performers, Portaloo provision and decorations.

But all of them have refused, said Deborah.

""The response has been soul destroying. I have contacted the Tory party, Labour and the Lib Dems. None of them have bothered to respond,"" she claimed.

Deborah has contacted parish councils and they too have not helped. A couple have replied saying they ""could not justify the expense"", she said.

""Since when has anyone needed to 'justify' supporting the bereaved? Many of us have so far have never been permitted a wake or memorial and an opportunity to unite in our grief.""

Deborah added: ""Many of these officials will stand before the public on May 6 'claiming 'to care for their constituents'. This simply does not seem to be true...Ironically, these will be the very same people who will be expected to receive an invite to this event and claim they have the bereaved in their thought and hearts.

She said the Parks Trust has been helpful and she has obtained all the necessary licences and permission to hold the memorial event. Milton Keynes Community Foundation has also agreed £3,000 of funding.

Deborah's mum and dad passed away just six months apart, though her mum died of cancer. The memorial event is to remember all lives lost during the pandemic, whether or not Covid was the cause of death.

Deborah founded a support group called Covid19 Families because she was horrified at the lack of support she received when her father died. During lockdown, shut away from sympathetic relatives, colleagues and friends, and unable to even organise a proper funeral, she felt very alone, she said.

""The one group who are actually receiving very, very little support are the Covid bereaved... It's hard enough to lose someone at anytime but losing someone during the lockdown was and still is horrendous, and the long term mental health effects of grieving during lockdown are yet to manifest themselves.""

Covid19 Families group soon spread all over the UK. There are now 37 regional groups, supporting more than 3,500 bereaved people, said Deborah.

She believes the MK memorial event would attract national media and TV coverage.

""It will allow the many who have been denied a moment to reflect and unite in grief that final act of closure. Not just the families, but friends, neighbours, work colleagues, and associates,"" she said.

""For over a year now, those experiencing grief have been denied the right to remember and mark the passing of their loved ones due to pandemic restrictions, and for many, myself including this is an important part of the grieving process - closure.

""This event now has the dubious honour of becoming the very first public attendance memorial event to take place anywhere in the UK and will quite literally shine a light on Milton Keynes and show just how a memorial event can go ahead in a safe and socially distanced manner leading the way for the rest of the country.""

But the woman behind the mass memorial is furious because she says local parish councils and MK Council have refused to support the event, which is called Candleight4covid.

Deborah Lewis, who lost her dad to Covid last April, said: ""I have done my utmost to remain strictly non-political but, I can no longer sit back and let the sheer hypocrisy continue, especially from elected official in Milton Keynes who will shortly go to the polls claiming they care about their constituents.""

She approached MK Council and parish councils all over MK to ask for contributions towards the cost of the event, which will consist of a lantern parade followed by a ceremony in MK Rose on June 23.

Deborah's mum and dad died within six months of each other

The cash was needed to pay for public liability insurance, staging, lighting, and sound, a wet weather shelter and seating for dignitaries and performers, Portaloo provision and decorations.

But all of them have refused, said Deborah.

""The response has been soul destroying. I have contacted the Tory party, Labour and the Lib Dems. None of them have bothered to respond,"" she claimed.

Deborah has contacted parish councils and they too have not helped. A couple have replied saying they ""could not justify the expense"", she said.

""Since when has anyone needed to 'justify' supporting the bereaved? Many of us have so far have never been permitted a wake or memorial and an opportunity to unite in our grief.""

Deborah added: ""Many of these officials will stand before the public on May 6 'claiming 'to care for their constituents'. This simply does not seem to be true...Ironically, these will be the very same people who will be expected to receive an invite to this event and claim they have the bereaved in their thought and hearts.

She said the Parks Trust has been helpful and she has obtained all the necessary licences and permission to hold the memorial event. Milton Keynes Community Foundation has also agreed £3,000 of funding.

Deborah's mum and dad passed away just six months apart, though her mum died of cancer. The memorial event is to remember all lives lost during the pandemic, whether or not Covid was the cause of death.

Deborah founded a support group called Covid19 Families because she was horrified at the lack of support she received when her father died. During lockdown, shut away from sympathetic relatives, colleagues and friends, and unable to even organise a proper funeral, she felt very alone, she said.

""The one group who are actually receiving very, very little support are the Covid bereaved... It's hard enough to lose someone at anytime but losing someone during the lockdown was and still is horrendous, and the long term mental health effects of grieving during lockdown are yet to manifest themselves.""

Covid19 Families group soon spread all over the UK. There are now 37 regional groups, supporting more than 3,500 bereaved people, said Deborah.

She believes the MK memorial event would attract national media and TV coverage.

""It will allow the many who have been denied a moment to reflect and unite in grief that final act of closure. Not just the families, but friends, neighbours, work colleagues, and associates,"" she said.

Councillors struggled with the paper prepared by officers on 30 new social homes in Gauldry, which ran to over 20,000 words and was packed with technical jargon.

It related to a bid by Kingdom Housing Association for 30 new social homes south of Balgove Road in the village, on agricultural land that was not earmarked for development in Fife s local development plan, known as FIFEplan.

Planning officers supported the bid despite it not meeting requirements for adequate garden space - but Kingdom's plans were opposed by 17 locals including Balmerino, Gauldry, Kilmany and Logie Community Council.

The proposed development at Gauldry

One of the most worrying aspects of the plan was the scale of the development compared to Balgove Road itself, which is a single-track road with few passing opportunities.

Cllr Tony Miklinski (Con, Cupar) branded the paper a ""complicated and difficult read"" - and took issue with the recommendation to approve once he had been able to decipher its contents.

He told the North East Planning Committee earlier this week: ""We've got a greenfield site and the developer wants to build so intensively that the gardens are too small.

""We're being asked to relax the recommendations on this occasion but we have been asked to 'relax on this occasion' multiple times. I wish I'd been keeping a scorecard.

""There needs to be something that says this development is particularly important or urgent that overcomes these objections. What we're being asked to do is to ignore the community and that makes me uncomfortable.""

SImilarly, Cllr David MacDiarmid (SNP, Howe of Fife and Tay Coast) was concerned about the ""really technical"" report prepared by planning officers - but ultimately supported the plans.

""I can't recall seeing anything like this laid out before for such a small development and I find this really complicated,"" he said. ""I have no criticism of the case officer, but I think for the ordinary layman it might be problematic.""

At 38 pages long, the Gauldry report for 30 homes was almost as long as a paper presented to councillors in January on the 681-bed Albany Park student accommodation planned for St Andrews, and longer than other comparable papers on small housing developments.

However, council solicitor Steven Paterson said it was acceptable, adding: ""I would not expect a report to be less than what we have here. The case officer has come to a firm view that there is a proven need (for housing in the area).""

Development management boss Alastair Hamilton defended the report and its recommendations, adding: “There is a shortfall and a policy which makes provision to consider and approve housing sites for affordable housing outwith settlement boundaries.""

Five councillors voted in favour of a motion tabled by Cllr Tim Brett (Lib Dem, Tay Bridgehead) and seconded by Cllr Miklinski to refuse the plans.

However, nine voted in favour of Cllr Jonny Tepp's (Lib Dem, Tay Bridgehead) amendment, seconded by Cllr Karen Marjoram (SNP, Cupar) to approve the plans in line with the report.

The homes will be built to the Passivhaus standard that are highly energy efficient. A derelict house at 30 Balgrove Road demolished to create an access into the new neighbourhood.

However, council solicitor Steven Paterson said it was acceptable, adding: ""I would not expect a report to be less than what we have here. The case officer has come to a firm view that there is a proven need (for housing in the area).""

Development management boss Alastair Hamilton defended the report and its recommendations, adding: “There is a shortfall and a policy which makes provision to consider and approve housing sites for affordable housing outwith settlement boundaries.""

Five councillors voted in favour of a motion tabled by Cllr Tim Brett (Lib Dem, Tay Bridgehead) and seconded by Cllr Miklinski to refuse the plans.

However, nine voted in favour of Cllr Jonny Tepp's (Lib Dem, Tay Bridgehead) amendment, seconded by Cllr Karen Marjoram (SNP, Cupar) to approve the plans in line with the report.

As does the energy, dynamism and mesmerising talent of the young cast that brings seemingly random collections of thoughts together in the Minerva.

Their sheer ability to remember and recall word perfect this eclectic mix of views is in itself a major achievement.for unlike most plays there is no single strand of plot to guide them or the audience to the finish line.

What it reveals is not what divides this often culturally and ideologically diverse group of young people - but what they have in common.

As they move through their education, their aspirations differ widely - from going to Australia to get a tan, to playing basketball for their country, or simply being allowed to use their phone at more than just weekends.

It has been reported that mental health referrals surged by more than half during the covid period to unprecedented levels.

Such data is easy to believe from the insights of this new play - especially in its chronicling of lockdown itself in the final section.

Mr Abrahams’ decision to stand in this year’s Nottinghamshire County Council elections was met with scepticism from some residents, while his political rivals have questioned the logistics of a dual role.

The Labour Group leader on the district council, who was elected mayor in 2019, is one of 12 candidates battling for two seats which are up for grabs in Mansfield South.

And Mr Abrahams explained why, like Mansfield MP Ben Bradley, he has decided to stand in the election.

Andy Abrahams, leader of the Labour Group and Mansfield mayor.

""The decisions that have been taken at County Hall, with respect to social care, highways maintenance, waste management and education for the last four years affect all the residents of Mansfield,” he said.

""As one of the principal drivers of the Mansfield Health Commission, which brings together policy makers from the NHS, GP Surgeries, West Notts College, Nottingham Trent University and the Voluntary Sector, it makes perfect sense to have a strong voice at county to amalgamate social care and education policy so that we all move forward in the same direction together instead of working separately.

“Besides promoting progressive forward thinking policies on social care, transportation and education, the other major issue I will defend at County Hall is local democracy.

""Last year’s failed attempt at County Hall to force a single unitary council will be coming back and I believe that it is so important for Mansfield district to retain it’s significant historical identity and not ‘be swallowed up’ by the single county model that has been proposed.

“I am not opposed to any democratic proposals to improve the efficiency of local government but it has to be done in proper consultation with the residents and that’s why we need a strong voice who knows and believes in Mansfield at the negotiating table.”

As well as Mr Abrahams, also standing in Mansfield South are: Thorsten Altenkirch (Liberal Democrats), Kevin Brown (Mansfield Independents), Andre Camilleri (Conservative), Bill Drewett (Mansfield Independents), Robert Elliman (Conservative), Steve Garner (Independent), Sadie Kime (Independent), Maxi Leigh (Labour), Andy Rimmer (Liberal Democrats), Andy Sissons (Independent), Paul Tooley-Okonkwo (Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition).

That’s the message from Andrew Cooper, the chief executive of the Leeds Business Improvement District (LeedsBID).

The pandemic has changed everything for Leeds businesses.

As they adapt to Government restrictions, transform their outdoor seating areas and overhaul their plans for the future, LeedsBID has been supporting them every step of the way.

There have been some casualties of the pandemic, from small independents closing their doors to familiar chains disappearing from the high street.

But Leeds is “on the front foot”, Mr Cooper said, with lockdown providing opportunities for growth and change.

“We get on with it, we’re resilient, we support each other”, he told the YEP.

“It strikes me how adaptable businesses have been. We’ve had restrictions, furlough, grants - all these things thrown at businesses, but they have been able to cope with what has been a very challenging landscape.

“I’ve seen incredible resilience and collaboration, people working together in ways that I’ve not seen before. Competitors sharing their practices and signage and working together.

“As a city, we need to work together. That was the case last year and it’s great to see that carrying on as we come out of the restrictions.”

Non-essential retailers have now been closed for more than three months. The hospitality sector has sat empty since November.

As some businesses prepare to welcome back customers from April 12, Mr Cooper said he has noticed a buzz about the city centre again.

LeedsBID, a not-for-profit organisation, has helped to shape Leeds City Council’s reopening plans and coordinate distribution of the Government’s Welcome Back Fund, designed to get business back on their feet.

“It felt like a town closed down for winter in the city centre,” Mr Cooper added.

“But there’s lots of activity going on again, owners getting back into their shops and starting to prepare.

“They’re chomping at the bit to open. But there is some apprehension as you can’t always just turn on a tap. You need a bit of preparation, particularly in the hospitality sector.”

Mr Cooper said he was encouraged by the investment put into the city centre during lockdown, with big refurbishment projects such as at the Queens Hotel and retailers like Decathlon choosing to open new sites in Leeds.

He added: “Leeds is very much on the front foot, it’s been proactive in thinking longer-term and investors are thinking about Leeds’ long term game too.”

Despite his optimism, Mr Cooper does not underestimate the challenges the pandemic has presented to businesses.

LeedsBID is preparing a catalogue of events over the summer to generate footfall and drive customers back to the city centre.

It has lobbied on behalf of businesses to create new outdoor spaces and provides support through Engine Room - a hub offering free resources and training programmes including how to adapt to restrictions.

Mr Cooper said he hopes the new ways of working created by the pandemic may provide opportunities for positive change.

“Short-term opportunities because of Covid might turn into long-term changes in the city centre for good”, he added.

“If we want to encourage more of a cafe culture of people sitting outside, that provides opportunities to change the look and feel of the city centre.”

People’s spending habits will also have changed, Mr Cooper added, and building confidence in visiting the city centre will be the key to drive back customers.

Mr Cooper said: “Historically, Leeds has been a very traditional 9-5 city. We now have different working patterns and we’re not all coming into the city at the same time, certainly as restrictions are first lifted.

“It’s a very different city centre. Behaviours will change, people will be a bit nervous at first - it’s a bit like riding a bike again.

“We need to build confidence and reassure people that when you go into shop staff have been trained to make people safe.”

What are Mr Cooper’s hopes for the summer ahead?

“We want to see a very busy, vibrant, safe and happy city centre,” he said.

“The events we’re planning are centred around families and people of all ages, encouraging people to come back to enjoy the city centre they love and the haunts they have missed.

“We’re looking to create a happy and welcoming city. One where people are generous, kind and understanding towards each other.

“I think people’s behaviours have changed as a result of the pandemic and we want to embody that.”

Mr Cooper believes collaboration and a community spirit are what's needed to help the city centre bounce back as restrictions are eased.

He added: “If there is anything the pandemic has taught us, it’s that we can’t rest on our laurels.

“We need to continue that good collaboration and working together. I think the city will be stronger for it.”",ID_94,Leeds,Leeds; Maidstone,Leeds,yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk,article-2345255

The 2001 Ballon d'Or winner, who also played for Real Madrid, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Stoke City, is backing both Burnley and Everton to do the business midweek.

The 42-year-old, who netted 40 times for the Three Lions, has predicted a 1-0 win for the Clarets over Southampton at Turf Moor on Thursday evening and believes the Toffees will beat Leicester City by the same scoreline at Goodison Park tonight.

Speaking to BetVictor ahead of those fixtures, he said: ""I couldn’t believe that Burnley sacked Sean Dyche. It came out of nowhere, and still doesn’t really make sense. The players were shocked by it, so they deserve a lot of credit for the way they got a point against West Ham.

""I’m not sure there’s a more unpredictable side in the league than Southampton. They lost 6-0 against Chelsea the week before, and then beat Arsenal 1-0 the following week! Ralph Hasenhuttl must be as confused as anyone as to why his side are so inconsistent.

Speaking to BetVictor ahead of those fixtures, he said: ""I couldn’t believe that Burnley sacked Sean Dyche. It came out of nowhere, and still doesn’t really make sense. The players were shocked by it, so they deserve a lot of credit for the way they got a point against West Ham.

""I’m not sure there’s a more unpredictable side in the league than Southampton. They lost 6-0 against Chelsea the week before, and then beat Arsenal 1-0 the following week! Ralph Hasenhuttl must be as confused as anyone as to why his side are so inconsistent.

""This is a massive game for Burnley, and one of their more winnable remaining fixtures. Even with Sean Dyche leaving, I fancy Burnley to get the win. 1-0 Burnley.""",ID_95,LEEDS,Leeds; Maidstone,Burnley,burnleyexpress.net,article-2346080

The 2001 Ballon d'Or winner, who also played for Real Madrid, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Stoke City, is backing both Burnley and Everton to do the business midweek.

The 42-year-old, who netted 40 times for the Three Lions, has predicted a 1-0 win for the Clarets over Southampton at Turf Moor on Thursday evening and believes the Toffees will beat Leicester City by the same scoreline at Goodison Park tonight.

"What is your connection to East Anglia?

Amelia: I am pretty much East Anglian born and bred. We moved to Fressingfield on the Norfolk/Suffolk border when I was one. My parents still live in the same house in the village.

David: I was born in Rochford in Essex and have always lived and worked in the East Anglian region. First at Essex FM radio in Southend from 1995, then at the BBC in Chelmsford, before moving to Norwich in 2001 to work at BBC East. I joined ITV News Anglia in the summer of 2021.

What’s your East Anglian heaven?

Amelia: I love the big skies and the beaches and the feeling of home.

David: Well it has to be the beaches for me. Having grown up by the sea in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, I gravitate towards the water. I took up surfing in 2004, so the beaches of Norfolk and Suffolk are my happy places.

What’s your East Anglian hell?

Amelia: It’s a bit of a hassle getting anywhere else quickly either by road or train.

David: I agree with Amelia. Getting to and from anywhere can take its time, but that adds to the charm, right?

Your favourite local restaurants?

Amelia: I love getting fish and chips from the ‘black hut’ in the car park at Dunwich and eating them on the beach. I used to do that as a child and now enjoy doing it with our girls

David: For a special occasion I love the Wildebeest in Stoke Holy Cross, but also love grabbing a coffee and a bite from North Sea Coffee on the prom in Cromer.

Do you have a favourite East Anglian landmark?

Amelia: The war memorial on the A11 at Elveden. If we’ve been away it means we’re nearly home.

David: It has to be Cromer Pier for me. From my surfboard I've stared at it so many times. It's a wonderful structure.

The best thing that happens in East Anglia every year?

Amelia: The seasons. They are beautiful and clearly defined here and I love that.

David: I agree with Amelia on that one. Being surrounded by nature in this part of the world you certainly notice the changes far more.

What is your specialist Mastermind subject?

Amelia: I would be dreadful at that. I am a “know a little about lots of things” sort of girl!

David: Probably Star Wars!

What’s always in your fridge?

Salad, cheese and a cold beer...or three.

What’s your simple philosophy of life?

Amelia: It’s short. Live it!

David: Always be nice to people.

Do you have a favourite film?

Amelia: Love Actually

David: Star Wars. But also Jaws and Ghostbusters.

What was your first job?

Amelia: Weekend chambermaid at the Oaksmere Hotel near Eye in Suffolk (aged 15).

David: Spud boy in a fish and chip shop in Essex, I worked at a boatyard too at 15 years old. I was paid £1.50 an hour.

What is your most treasured possession?

Amelia: My family.

David: My family...and my surf board.

What’s your worst character trait?

Amelia: I have little patience

David Me too. Hurry up!

Where is your favourite holiday destination?

Amelia: I love the Greek islands and the north Norfolk coast.

David: Obviously the north Norfolk coast...and Portugal, the surf there is amazing.

Best day of your life?

Amelia: Marrying David, becoming a mum and then a family of 4. I know that’s three days.

David: Marrying Amelia, and becoming a dad.

What’s your favourite breakfast?

Amelia: Fruit, yoghurt, granola and honey. I could eat that for every meal.

David: A full English.

What’s your favourite tipple?

Amelia: A glass of chilled white wine.

David: Cold beer, always.

What’s your hidden talent?

Amelia: I play the piano and I am learning the saxophone.

David: Not sure I have any.

What’s your earliest memory?

Amelia: On the beach at Waldringfield where my grandparents took a leading role with the sailing club.

David: On the beach with my late parents. My love for the seaside started at a very young age, thanks to mum and dad.

What would you like played at your funeral?

Amelia: Whatever my family would like to listen to.

David: Something relevant I guess. Our first dance at our wedding was to ‘Somewhere beyond the sea’ - that would be a good one.

Tell us something people don’t know about you?

Amelia: I’m not sure there is anything. What you see is what you get

David: Growing up I wanted to be an actor, both my parents were. But I'm very happy doing what I do.

What’s the worst thing anyone has ever said to you?

Amelia: “I’m sorry, it’s cancer.” I was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year and underwent a course of radio and chemotherapy. Thanks to the wonderful staff at the N&N my six months scans were clear and I am feeling great.

David: Amelia telling me about her diagnosis.

Tell us why you live here and nowhere else?

Amelia: It’s home. Simple as that

David: We grew up here and it's everything to us.

What do you want to tell our readers about most?

Amelia: Watch BBC Look East, BBC 1 at 6.30pm every weekday.

David: Watch ITV News, Anglia ITV at 6pm weekdays.

Amelia: I play the piano and I am learning the saxophone.

David: Not sure I have any.

What’s your earliest memory?

Amelia: On the beach at Waldringfield where my grandparents took a leading role with the sailing club.

David: On the beach with my late parents. My love for the seaside started at a very young age, thanks to mum and dad.

What would you like played at your funeral?

Amelia: Whatever my family would like to listen to.

David: Something relevant I guess. Our first dance at our wedding was to ‘Somewhere beyond the sea’ - that would be a good one.

Tell us something people don’t know about you?

Amelia: I’m not sure there is anything. What you see is what you get

David: Growing up I wanted to be an actor, both my parents were. But I'm very happy doing what I do.

David: Amelia telling me about her diagnosis.

Tell us why you live here and nowhere else?

Amelia: It’s home. Simple as that

"What is your connection to East Anglia?

Amelia: I am pretty much East Anglian born and bred. We moved to Fressingfield on the Norfolk/Suffolk border when I was one. My parents still live in the same house in the village.

David: I was born in Rochford in Essex and have always lived and worked in the East Anglian region. First at Essex FM radio in Southend from 1995, then at the BBC in Chelmsford, before moving to Norwich in 2001 to work at BBC East. I joined ITV News Anglia in the summer of 2021.

What’s your East Anglian heaven?

Amelia: I love the big skies and the beaches and the feeling of home.

David: Well it has to be the beaches for me. Having grown up by the sea in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, I gravitate towards the water. I took up surfing in 2004, so the beaches of Norfolk and Suffolk are my happy places.

What’s your East Anglian hell?

Amelia: It’s a bit of a hassle getting anywhere else quickly either by road or train.

David: I agree with Amelia. Getting to and from anywhere can take its time, but that adds to the charm, right?

Your favourite local restaurants?

Amelia: I love getting fish and chips from the ‘black hut’ in the car park at Dunwich and eating them on the beach. I used to do that as a child and now enjoy doing it with our girls

David: For a special occasion I love the Wildebeest in Stoke Holy Cross, but also love grabbing a coffee and a bite from North Sea Coffee on the prom in Cromer.

Do you have a favourite East Anglian landmark?

Amelia: The war memorial on the A11 at Elveden. If we’ve been away it means we’re nearly home.

David: It has to be Cromer Pier for me. From my surfboard I've stared at it so many times. It's a wonderful structure.

The best thing that happens in East Anglia every year?

Amelia: The seasons. They are beautiful and clearly defined here and I love that.

David: I agree with Amelia on that one. Being surrounded by nature in this part of the world you certainly notice the changes far more.

What is your specialist Mastermind subject?

Amelia: I would be dreadful at that. I am a “know a little about lots of things” sort of girl!

David: Probably Star Wars!

What’s always in your fridge?

Salad, cheese and a cold beer...or three.

What’s your simple philosophy of life?

Amelia: It’s short. Live it!

David: Always be nice to people.

Do you have a favourite film?

Amelia: Love Actually

David: Star Wars. But also Jaws and Ghostbusters.

What was your first job?

Amelia: Weekend chambermaid at the Oaksmere Hotel near Eye in Suffolk (aged 15).

David: Spud boy in a fish and chip shop in Essex, I worked at a boatyard too at 15 years old. I was paid £1.50 an hour.

What is your most treasured possession?

Amelia: My family.

David: My family...and my surf board.

What’s your worst character trait?

Amelia: I have little patience

David Me too. Hurry up!

Where is your favourite holiday destination?

Amelia: I love the Greek islands and the north Norfolk coast.

David: Obviously the north Norfolk coast...and Portugal, the surf there is amazing.

Best day of your life?

Amelia: Marrying David, becoming a mum and then a family of 4. I know that’s three days.

David: Marrying Amelia, and becoming a dad.

What’s your favourite breakfast?

Amelia: Fruit, yoghurt, granola and honey. I could eat that for every meal.

David: A full English.

What’s your favourite tipple?

Amelia: A glass of chilled white wine.

David: Cold beer, always.

David: My family...and my surf board.

What’s your worst character trait?

Amelia: I have little patience

David Me too. Hurry up!

Where is your favourite holiday destination?

Amelia: I love the Greek islands and the north Norfolk coast.

David: Obviously the north Norfolk coast...and Portugal, the surf there is amazing.

Best day of your life?

Amelia: Marrying David, becoming a mum and then a family of 4. I know that’s three days.

What’s your favourite breakfast?

Amelia: I play the piano and I am learning the saxophone.

David: Not sure I have any.

What’s your earliest memory?

David: On the beach with my late parents. My love for the seaside started at a very young age, thanks to mum and dad.

What would you like played at your funeral?

Amelia: Whatever my family would like to listen to.

Amelia: I’m not sure there is anything. What you see is what you get

David: Growing up I wanted to be an actor, both my parents were. But I'm very happy doing what I do.

Amelia: “I’m sorry, it’s cancer.” I was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year and underwent a course of radio and chemotherapy. Thanks to the wonderful staff at the N&N my six months scans were clear and I am feeling great.

David: Amelia telling me about her diagnosis.

Tell us why you live here and nowhere else?

Amelia: It’s home. Simple as that

"What is your connection to East Anglia?

Amelia: I am pretty much East Anglian born and bred. We moved to Fressingfield on the Norfolk/Suffolk border when I was one. My parents still live in the same house in the village.

David: I was born in Rochford in Essex and have always lived and worked in the East Anglian region. First at Essex FM radio in Southend from 1995, then at the BBC in Chelmsford, before moving to Norwich in 2001 to work at BBC East. I joined ITV News Anglia in the summer of 2021.

What’s your East Anglian heaven?

Amelia: I love the big skies and the beaches and the feeling of home.

David: Well it has to be the beaches for me. Having grown up by the sea in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, I gravitate towards the water. I took up surfing in 2004, so the beaches of Norfolk and Suffolk are my happy places.

What’s your East Anglian hell?

Amelia: It’s a bit of a hassle getting anywhere else quickly either by road or train.

David: I agree with Amelia. Getting to and from anywhere can take its time, but that adds to the charm, right?

Your favourite local restaurants?

Amelia: I love getting fish and chips from the ‘black hut’ in the car park at Dunwich and eating them on the beach. I used to do that as a child and now enjoy doing it with our girls

David: For a special occasion I love the Wildebeest in Stoke Holy Cross, but also love grabbing a coffee and a bite from North Sea Coffee on the prom in Cromer.

Do you have a favourite East Anglian landmark?

Amelia: The war memorial on the A11 at Elveden. If we’ve been away it means we’re nearly home.

David: It has to be Cromer Pier for me. From my surfboard I've stared at it so many times. It's a wonderful structure.

The best thing that happens in East Anglia every year?

Amelia: The seasons. They are beautiful and clearly defined here and I love that.

David: I agree with Amelia on that one. Being surrounded by nature in this part of the world you certainly notice the changes far more.

What is your specialist Mastermind subject?

Amelia: I would be dreadful at that. I am a “know a little about lots of things” sort of girl!

David: Probably Star Wars!

What’s always in your fridge?

Salad, cheese and a cold beer...or three.

What’s your simple philosophy of life?

Amelia: It’s short. Live it!

David: Always be nice to people.

Do you have a favourite film?

Amelia: Love Actually

David: Star Wars. But also Jaws and Ghostbusters.

What was your first job?

Amelia: Weekend chambermaid at the Oaksmere Hotel near Eye in Suffolk (aged 15).

David: Spud boy in a fish and chip shop in Essex, I worked at a boatyard too at 15 years old. I was paid £1.50 an hour.

"When shopping here in the United Kingdom, the supermarket wars are a big deal.
With rising competition across the biggest names in the industry, each supermarket is always looking for ways to sweeten the deal with customers.
If you shop at Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Marks and Spencer or Boots, you'll already know that they have loyalty schemes to benefit their regular shoppers.
These schemes aim to offer rewards that keep customers coming back, such as discounted items, vouchers or special bonuses.
However, with supermarkets changing all the time, it can be confusing to understand whether you're more suited to Tesco Clubcard or collecting Nectar points at Sainsbury's.
That's why we've simplified what each major supermarket and shop offers so you can decide which are worth your time.
Here are the things you need to know about each scheme:
Tesco - Clubcard and Clubcard Plus
With a Tesco Clubcard, you can gain clubcard points on purchases in store, whether it be Tesco homeware, groceries, clothing or petrol.
Every £1 spent in store equates to one Clubcard point. For petrol, its £2 per point.
These Clubcard points can be exchanged for Tesco Clubcard Vouchers - 150 points means £1.50 off in store.
If you want something different, these vouchers can be exchanged for other rewards such as days out or money off meals in top restaurants.
Depending how you spend your voucher, the value can increase.
Points can currently be collected using either a physical Tesco Clubcard, a key fob or Tesco Clubcard App.
Sign up to the EssexLive newsletter If you're looking for a way to stay up-to-date with the latest breaking news from around Essex, the EssexLive newsletter is a good place to start. The twice-daily update will deliver the top news and features to your inbox every morning and evening. We choose the most important stories of the day to include in the newsletter, including crime, court news, long reads, traffic and travel, food and drink articles and more. Signing up to the newsletter is simple. All you have to do is to click here and type in your email address. It's one of the many ways that you can read the news that matters to you from EssexLive.
Tesco Clubcard can also be earned if you have a Tesco Credit Card - with every £4 equalling one point.
Tesco also has a subscription service called Clubcard Plus, which has even more benefits.
Clubcard Plus members can get discounts on own-branded Tesco products and also received double data on Tesco Mobile.
They can also get 10 per cent off two 'big-shops' per year - whenever they want.
Clubcard Plus works out to £7.99 per month, whereas a regular Tesco Clubcard is completely free.
Morrisons - Morrisons More
(Image: Google)
At Morrisons, points are collected via Morrisons More every time you shop in store.
You can get five points per £1 you spend either at the shop or inside the Morrisons Cafe.
Shoppers can also earn five points per litre when you buy petrol at Morrisons petrol stations.
For every 5,000 points you earn, you can get a £5 Morrisons voucher.
If you have a Morrisons More card, you can also stay up-to-date with how many points you have using the Morrisons More app.
The vouchers you receive are uploaded to the app and can be used in store.
Morrisons also personalise your vouchers based on your previous purchases on the app, which you can use in store too instead of using your physical More card.
Depending on your situation, you can get a different type of More card. These include students, parents and NHS workers.
At Christmas time, Morrisons More customers can buy digital saving stamps on the app that are redeemable in December to make that busy time of year a little bit cheaper.
Sainsbury's - Nectar
(Image: PA)
One of the most well-know supermarket saving schemes is at Sainsbury's where you can become a nectar customer.
Sainsbury's has been offering the nectar scheme since 2002, where shoppers can earn one nectar point for every £1 spent in store or every litre of petrol purchased at one of their petrol stations.
There are currently around 18 million nectar users across the world.
For every 500 nectar points, shoppers can get an impressive £2.50 off their Sainsbury's shop.
These points can also be redeemed at Argos too.
Vouchers can be used via the Nectar Card app or automatically at self-checkout as a payment option.
Shoppers also earn nectar points through a huge selection of retailers via nectar.com.
You nectar point balance is printed on the back of every Sainsbury's receipt you receive.
M&S - Sparks Card
A membership to Marks and Spencer's Sparks Card is also free to join.
Every shop visit adds 10 sparks to your card, with a further 10 sparks added to your account for every £1 you spend.
You can also get sparks points if you review items on the M&S website - 25 sparks per review.
The more sparks you get, the more gets donated to your chosen charity.
M&S say that the store will also send customers personalised offers based on what you usually buy and what you review online.
If you collect 3,000 sparks, you can enjoy fast-track access to the latest products and trends.
Once you reach 5,000 sparks, you can jump the queue in the M&S sales.
For those wanting to keep track of how many sparks you have, you can do this via the M&S app.
Boots - Advantage Card
When you shop at Boots, you can collect four Boots points on your Advantage Card for every £1 you spend in store.
The Boots Advantage app also allows you to collect points through your phone.
You can get a whopping 200 Boots Advantage points for free if you register your card through the app and use it to make a purchase.
Each Boots point is worth 1p - so 200 Boots points can be exchanged for £2 off a purchase.
You can spend your Boots points either in store or online at boots.come by selecting the Boots Advantage Card icon once you checkout.
Based on what you buy with Boots, you will also received personalised offers.
Anyone who is a member of the Boots Pregnant and Parenting Club can also receive double points on purchases.
Student, who can sometimes find money hard to come by, can get 10 per cent discount by joining the Advantage Card club.
Your points balance is usually visible on the bottom of your Boots receipt and on the Advantage Card app.",ID_98,the Morrisons Cafe,Angus; Bolton; Derby; Glasgow City; Leeds; Newham; Sheffield,Chelmsford,essexlive.news,article-2437731

"Work is well underway in Coventry city centre to get a new festival gardens and events venue ready for July.
Assembly Festival Garden has been described as ""dynamic and celebratory entertainment, food, drink and events space"".
From July to October the festival garden will host a circus, cabaret, food vendors and open-air shows to keep local people entertained all summer.
The site is based on the site of the demolished former Civic Centre buildings, now owned by Coventry University, opposite the Council House.
When CoventryLive saw the site this week, final touches were being put to the grounds, and a circus tent and fairy lights could be seen towering above fencing.
Assembly Festival Garden will be a hub for City of Culture celebrations, and will even include a 1,000-seat tent for performances and events.
The gardens have been brought to Coventry by Assembly Festival, a venue producer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in partnership with the UK City of Culture Trust and Coventry University, who have handed over the space for free.
And previews shared on Instagram show just how spectacular the space looks to be.
Sharing a picture from inside the site, the City of Culture team wrote on their Instagram page: ""The Queen of Flanders Spiegeltent has arrived at @AssemblyFest Garden! Situated in @CovCityCentre, it will host the incredible @ChoirOfMan, @Circolombia and @DinoWorldLive from July. Book your tickets now at coventry2021.co.uk.""
Instagram users also shared their excitement ahead of the Garden's July opening. One user commented: ""This looks magical!.""
Another added: ""Love the look of this.""
What can we expect to see?
Organisers say Assembly Festival Garden will be open from July 1 to mid-October.
Performances will take place in the Queen of Flanders, an iconic and beautiful 1,000-seater double-decker Spiegeltent; the Piccolo, a smaller 180-seat Spiegeltent; a treehouse that will look out over the site; and an outdoor venue in front of the Piccolo which can play to the entire audience in the Garden.
The site will also play host to a mouth-watering selection of local food makers.
There will be a series of productions spanning cabaret, circus, comedy and children’s shows that will call the Gardens home for the summer, as well as a selection of high-profile comedy and music gigs from well-known faces alongside rising stars.

Assembly Festival Garden has been described as ""dynamic and celebratory entertainment, food, drink and events space"".
From July to October the festival garden will host a circus, cabaret, food vendors and open-air shows to keep local people entertained all summer.
The site is based on the site of the demolished former Civic Centre buildings, now owned by Coventry University, opposite the Council House.
When CoventryLive saw the site this week, final touches were being put to the grounds, and a circus tent and fairy lights could be seen towering above fencing.
Assembly Festival Garden will be a hub for City of Culture celebrations, and will even include a 1,000-seat tent for performances and events.
The gardens have been brought to Coventry by Assembly Festival, a venue producer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in partnership with the UK City of Culture Trust and Coventry University, who have handed over the space for free.
And previews shared on Instagram show just how spectacular the space looks to be.
Sharing a picture from inside the site, the City of Culture team wrote on their Instagram page: ""The Queen of Flanders Spiegeltent has arrived at @AssemblyFest Garden! Situated in @CovCityCentre, it will host the incredible @ChoirOfMan, @Circolombia and @DinoWorldLive from July. Book your tickets now at coventry2021.co.uk.""
Instagram users also shared their excitement ahead of the Garden's July opening. One user commented: ""This looks magical!.""
Another added: ""Love the look of this.""
What can we expect to see?
Organisers say Assembly Festival Garden will be open from July 1 to mid-October.
Performances will take place in the Queen of Flanders, an iconic and beautiful 1,000-seater double-decker Spiegeltent; the Piccolo, a smaller 180-seat Spiegeltent; a treehouse that will look out over the site; and an outdoor venue in front of the Piccolo which can play to the entire audience in the Garden.
The site will also play host to a mouth-watering selection of local food makers.
There will be a series of productions spanning cabaret, circus, comedy and children’s shows that will call the Gardens home for the summer, as well as a selection of high-profile comedy and music gigs from well-known faces alongside rising stars.

"A town centre business has moved location to allow them to expand.
Custom Bicycles Ltd in Stone sell all types of bikes, accessories, clothing and tools along with servicing and repairing all bikes including ebikes.
After 28 years of being based on Radford Street, with four different owners during that time, the business has now relocated to The Boat Yard.
Owner Kane Barber was always in the shop growing up but only bought the business around two years ago.
The 24-year-old, from Stone, explains: ""I took the shop over from a guy called Matt who owned the shop for 10 years. I used to be a good customer to Matt when I was a child and always went there for any parts I needed.
""Over the years I made good friends with him and when he spoke to me regarding selling the business I jumped at the opportunity. It was a dream come true.""
Now Kane has moved the business less than a mile away, to a building that is ten times the size of the old shop.

“We had been struggling for space in the old shop for around a year and we also wanted to offer more to our customer which we could only do with a bigger shop.
“We wanted to stay in Stone because it has a great sense of community and opened our new shop on Saturday, November 7.

"Among the runners getting ready for the evening’s seasonal celebration is the manager of the Enniskillen branch of Murdock Builders Merchants, Ben Millar.

Although an experienced runner, Ben is going to sample the unique Hallowe’en atmosphere of the Spooktacular for the first time, as he takes on the scenic 5K route around the town.

“This is the first time I have been involved, and that is why I am so excited about it,” he said. “I have done plenty of other runs in the past, but this is my first time doing the 5K around the town. I have been training on the sly for it!

“I always have been doing 10Ks, but I would never have done a 5K. It would be out of my zone, in a sense, so it’s a challenge for me because it is a quicker run, but I can’t wait.

“It should be good fun. I was always a runner since I was at school. I wouldn’t be a competitive runner that has competed a thousand times, but I am looking forward to this one, because it is a unique run.”

Ben and Murdocks were delighted to be able to provide sponsorship for an event that has established itself as one of the annual town highlights since its inception more than 10 years ago.

“We are delighted to be part of it,” he admitted. “The running club approached us and we grabbed it with both hands. It is something we are delighted to be involved in because of the community spirit that is behind it all.

“It’s a very unique run. Not only does it involve all ages and abilities, but it is the fact that it is a night-time run, its on an island, and it is a fun run as well as getting a high standard of competition.

“There is an excitement and a buzz about it, and anyone I speak to about it seems to be really looking forward to it.”

The event has become an important fixture in the calendar of local runners of all abilities, from the serious athlete to the fun runners and walkers, but Ben, from Derrygonnelly, is taking the competitive element of the run seriously and hoping to draw on his running experience to post a respectable time over the course, although he was not revealing the 5K time he was aiming for.

“I kind of have a target.” he acknowledged.

“I have a fair idea of my abilities in it, but I do have a strategy.

“I have a target in my head but whether I perform on the night is another thing. I’m afraid of witches and ghosts so I’m going to keep all of them behind me!”",ID_16,Enniskillen,Fermanagh and Omagh; Mid Ulster,Fermanagh and Omagh,impartialreporter.com,article-367831

"As friends joked what would happen if he grew his hair out, the normally clean-shaven Adam Alderman wondered if there was a way he could use this in support of a good cause.

The Sudbury resident is now going an entire year without a haircut or shaving his head, inspired by the efforts of front-line NHS personnel who have battled against the coronavirus outbreak over the last 12 months.

His aim is to raise money for The Captain Tom Foundation – a national charity set up in honour of Captain Sir Tom Moore (pictured), the Second World War veteran who raised millions of pounds for the NHS during the pandemic, prior to his death last month, at the age of 100.

“What an inspirational man he was, especially in the tough times we’ve all been having,” said Adam, of Talbot Road.

“I last had a haircut at the beginning of February, so I can next cut my hair at the start of February 2022. It was all a bit of a joke to start with, because a few friends asked what would I look like with hair.

“I’ve always had a shaved head, because I’m going bald, so I think I will end up looking like Bill Bailey.

“One of my friends set up a fundraising page and, before I knew it, there were donations coming in. I thought, there’s no going back now.”

Adam, a competitive power-lifter, explained that part of the inspiration for the fundraiser had also come from his employment at Siemens Healthineers, the medical equipment manufacturing firm located in Sudbury.

He stated his work at the Northern Road-based company has continued throughout the pandemic to ensure hospitals have enough essential medical supplies available during this challenging time.

He added: “The support from everybody who has donated has been amazing.

“The fundraising page only had a £500 target to start with, and we were over halfway there within just two days, and I’ve still got a whole year to go. I thought, how generous and brilliant these people are.”

For the duration of the fundraiser, Adam will be posting monthly updates online to keep supporters in tune with his progress.

He added: “The support from everybody who has donated has been amazing.

“The fundraising page only had a £500 target to start with, and we were over halfway there within just two days, and I’ve still got a whole year to go. I thought, how generous and brilliant these people are.”

For the duration of the fundraiser, Adam will be posting monthly updates online to keep supporters in tune with his progress.

"Aspire Living, which has a centre in Hereford for adults with learning disabilities as well as its headquarters, said the changes would see a pay rise of at least three per cent for most workers.

It comes after UNISON claimed that if staff didn't accept changes, they would be sacked.

A spokesperson for Aspire Living said: “We are surprised and rather saddened to hear the scare stories being made about our staff.

""We are in a process of consultation with our workforce about a number of changes; absolutely no redundancies have been announced and nor will any be announced; nor is there any proposal to reduce staff pensions

""The consultation will actually provide staff with more career opportunities and we are creating 18 new roles in the New Year. We need more staff, not fewer, to be able to provide our charitable services.

""In fact, the majority of our staff will see their pay rise by at least three per cent and this is likely to be backdated.

""This comes on top of a pay increase last April for the majority of our support workers.""

The consolation has been extended ""to provide staff with more opportunity to talk"" to bosses, the company said.

The spokesperson added: ""We have been pleased and impressed to see the level of engagement from them and from their employee consultative council representatives.

""There will be some changes of course to terms and conditions, but this will enable us to make better use of our limited charitable resources across the whole workforce.

""This is not therefore a gloom and doom story. We are investing in our staff, providing pay increases and greater career opportunities for the majority during these very tough times.""

"Care for dying patients is currently provided in Whipps Cross’ highly regarded Margaret Centre

By Local Democracy Reporter Josh Mellor

Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone

Whipps Cross chiefs have yet to decide “completely” whether there will be a specialist end-of-life ward in the new hospital.

An “outline” hospital plan was approved by Waltham Forest Council on 24th November but the exact design is still being negotiated with the government.

Campaigners fear specialist palliative care unit The Margaret Centre may not be rebuilt, which they argue could leave patients to have a “traumatic” death at home.

At a joint committee meeting to scrutinise plans for the new hospital on 6th December, Action4Whipps campaigner Frances Simmons warned the service could end up being “precariously funded” if “decoupled” from the hospital.

She said: “Specialist palliative care at end-of-life units can’t be replaced in people’s own homes or hospitals.

“From personal experience related to us, families want to be supported through long illnesses, and for people to have a good death.

“It’s a huge responsibility for someone with complex needs to die at home, it’s traumatic when it goes badly wrong.”

Redbridge councillor Juditch Garfield agreed that the level of care would be diminished if palliative care was “dotted around” the hospital.

She added: “My view would really be that unless there is a specialist in-patient unit I have grave concerns that this is going to result in poorer outcomes for people at end of life and am very concerned about that.”

The hospital’s new chief executive, Ralph Coulbeck, insisted that nothing has yet been “decided on completely”.

He said: “The thing that we’ve come to recognise about the Margaret Centre is the benefits of seamless transition the centre’s environment creates and the focus on end-of-life care.

“All those all things will be carried on to the new hospital, we haven’t made that decision about how that would be configured,

“The old hospital has very few side rooms, it’s cramped, not conducive to end-of-life care, in that context we have to look at how we approach the Margaret Centre in that new environment.”

“We have not necessarily decided on a completely dispersed service, I would stress that while the Margaret Centre is highly valued and, we’ve heard a lot this evening, we still provide the end-of-life care across the hospital that is often necessary.”

Pam Cameron, South Antrim DUP MLA, said: “This is tragic news coming from Templepatrick.

“My thoughts are of course with the family and friends of the individual who has lost their life.

"A MOTHER is furious that her severely disabled son was injured while being treated in hospital.

Julie Maxx, 56, said an apology was not enough after she found her son Tyler, 24, with burns on his neck, shoulder and face as well as bruising on both arms while visiting him at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.

She claims staff at the Reading hospital showed a lack of care and understanding towards her son, who was born with brain damage, severe learning disabilities and cerebral palsy.

The Royal Berkshire Foundation Trust says it is investigating the “unexplained” injuries. Tyler, who is nicknamed “Tyler smiler” for his infectious grin, was being treated for a snapped titanium rod in his spine when Ms Maxx discovered his injuries on August 12, just over a month after he had been admitted.

Tyler lives in a flat below his mother in Gainsborough Crescent, Henley, and regularly attends the Chiltern Centre, a respite centre for disabled young adults off Greys Road. On July 3 he began suffering nosebleeds and chronic seizures and was experiencing intense pain when he moved.

Ms Maxx, who is her son’s full-time carer, believed he had a chest infection and after a week without any sign of improvement called paramedics who took him to the emergency department at the Royal Berks.

After he underwent blood tests and an X-ray, Ms Maxx was told her son had snapped the rod in his spine and would need to stay in the hospital.

Tyler, who has scoliosis and requires the use of a wheelchair, underwent surgery when he was 12 and had two titanium rods placed in his back.

Ms Maxx said: “I was absolutely mortified because I wasn’t aware that these things could snap. That would explain the agony and why my son was in so much pain.”

She had begun to feel unwell herself and, anxious not to infect her son, left the hospital in the early hours of July 11. She remained at home for the next 11 days with a chest infection.

In the meantime, Tyler was transferred to a bed on the acute medical ward.

Ms Maxx, who has cared for Tyler since birth, claims there was a lack of communication between her and the hospital during this time, so she was often unaware of her son’s condition.

She said: “I wanted the nursing staff to let me know how my son was. How was he eating? Had he been sleeping? Was he comfortable? What was happening next?

“From the bits of conversation that I could get, [I learned] they were all making decisions about my son without even contacting me.

“I was so angry. I’m his mum, full-time carer and appointee. They had to speak to me because Tyler cannot converse with them.

“They were doing their own thing and making decisions about my son.”

The hospital’s spinal team decided that surgery on Tyler was too risky and referred him to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for assessment.

He was moved to the short stay ward and Ms Maxx was able to visit him on July 22.

She said: “He was just beaming, we both were. We hadn’t seen each for two weeks. He was so happy and everybody said they could see it on his face.

“His mood was brilliant because I was there. He looked really sad before I walked in.”

Ms Maxx had to cancel Tyler’s first assessment at the John Radcliffe on August 5 due to a problem with her van and it was rescheduled for a week later.

Tyler was moved to the Castle Ward, where he shared a room with five older men, none of whom was disabled.

During a visit on August 8 with snacks and books, Ms Maxx noticed signs of distress in her son’s behaviour.

Tyler had bitten his hand and shredded two of the Postman Pat books he had been left with. Ms Maxx said: “I know my son. If he does that and bites, he’s not happy about something.

“[It happens] when he’s not getting enough attention, if he’s hurt, if he’s upset or if he’s being ignored. Those are big distress signs to me.

“He looked unkempt, he didn’t look washed or cleaned and his teeth hadn’t been cleaned.

“When I walked in he just looked really sad, like nobody had spoken to him. Then I noticed he had a big bruise between his thumb and forefinger. It didn’t look like a place where they take blood. They normally take it from the top of the hand.”

Following her visit, Ms Maxx complained to the hospital via email.

Her next visit was on the day of Tyler’s rescheduled assessment when she arrived at 7.50am.

She said: “They let me walk right past them and find my son. Nobody stopped me and said, ‘Julie, there has been a bit of an accident’.

“I got there and I put my arm around him and gave him a kiss on the head. Then I thought, ‘What is all that round his neck? All this white stuff’.

“When I pulled the gown down, I could see he had really nasty burns, all bubbled up.”

Tyler had burns from his right shoulder to his chin as well as on his back and face, which had been treated with Sudocrem. There was also bruising on both Tyler’s arms.

Ms Maxx said: “He was in shock. He didn’t smile at me like he normally does. He’d been really happy to see me when I had gone before but there was no smile this time. He must have been in agony.”

She said she was angry when she saw the burns and bruises and shouted, “What has happened to my son” but was not offered an explanation.

Despite his condition, Tyler was still taken to the John Radcliffe by ambulance for assessment.

Nurses there cleaned and dressed the burns and Ms Maxx said one nurse was shocked at the extent of the injuries. The assessment confirmed that surgery would be too dangerous and Tyler was taken back to the Royal Berks.

Ms Maxx said leaving Tyler that evening made her feel like “the worst mother on earth”.

She said: “I hated leaving my son there. Inside I was still full of rage and hurt and I was devastated at what had happened to him.

“I was sitting there just wanting to pick him up and take him home but I had to leave him there on the ward where this had happened.”

Ms Maxx filed a complaint with the hospital and called the police once she got home.

On August 22 she gave a statement to detectives and showed them pictures of Tyler’s injuries.

The police have since confirmed they are not investigating and have referred the issue to the hospital.

Tyler was placed in Sidmouth Ward but has since been transferred to the respiratory ward after testing positive for covid-19 last week.

Ms Maxx said she had spoken to director of nursing Jessica Higson and renal matron Angela Clarke and was confident the hospital was taking her complaint seriously.

She said: “I am absolutely sick to death of disabled people having accidents when they are in other people’s care.

“This is 2022 and the world needs to finally wake up to disabled people. They are still human beings, they’re just wired differently. They still have feelings like the rest of us.

“In the hospital, I feel my son was neglected because they didn’t know how to deal with him. I thought I’d put him somewhere safe.

“I’ve had quite a few apologies from people at the hospital but it’s not enough. They need to learn from this. This is serious.

“It should never have happened and should never ever happen again.”

Sally Moore, head of communications and engagement at Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: “We are sorry Tyler sustained these currently unexplained injuries to his neck, shoulder and arm and we are working with our colleagues, including the police and social care, to investigate all the

circumstances.

“Our director of nursing has spoken to Ms Maxx and reassured her that we will continue to work with her to establish what happened.

“We have also assured her that our staff are dedicated to providing the best possible care to our patients and ensuring their families and carers are fully informed and involved in their treatment at all times.

“Our investigation will include a review of the engagement between Ms Maxx and our staff to see if we can make any further improvements.”

Ms Maxx said: “I was absolutely mortified because I wasn’t aware that these things could snap. That would explain the agony and why my son was in so much pain.”

She had begun to feel unwell herself and, anxious not to infect her son, left the hospital in the early hours of July 11. She remained at home for the next 11 days with a chest infection.

In the meantime, Tyler was transferred to a bed on the acute medical ward.

Ms Maxx, who has cared for Tyler since birth, claims there was a lack of communication between her and the hospital during this time, so she was often unaware of her son’s condition.

She said: “I wanted the nursing staff to let me know how my son was. How was he eating? Had he been sleeping? Was he comfortable? What was happening next?

“From the bits of conversation that I could get, [I learned] they were all making decisions about my son without even contacting me.

“I was so angry. I’m his mum, full-time carer and appointee. They had to speak to me because Tyler cannot converse with them.

“They were doing their own thing and making decisions about my son.”

The hospital’s spinal team decided that surgery on Tyler was too risky and referred him to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for assessment.

He was moved to the short stay ward and Ms Maxx was able to visit him on July 22.

She said: “He was just beaming, we both were. We hadn’t seen each for two weeks. He was so happy and everybody said they could see it on his face.

“His mood was brilliant because I was there. He looked really sad before I walked in.”

Ms Maxx had to cancel Tyler’s first assessment at the John Radcliffe on August 5 due to a problem with her van and it was rescheduled for a week later.

Tyler was moved to the Castle Ward, where he shared a room with five older men, none of whom was disabled.

During a visit on August 8 with snacks and books, Ms Maxx noticed signs of distress in her son’s behaviour.

Tyler had bitten his hand and shredded two of the Postman Pat books he had been left with. Ms Maxx said: “I know my son. If he does that and bites, he’s not happy about something.

“[It happens] when he’s not getting enough attention, if he’s hurt, if he’s upset or if he’s being ignored. Those are big distress signs to me.

“He looked unkempt, he didn’t look washed or cleaned and his teeth hadn’t been cleaned.

“When I walked in he just looked really sad, like nobody had spoken to him. Then I noticed he had a big bruise between his thumb and forefinger. It didn’t look like a place where they take blood. They normally take it from the top of the hand.”

Following her visit, Ms Maxx complained to the hospital via email.

Her next visit was on the day of Tyler’s rescheduled assessment when she arrived at 7.50am.

She said: “They let me walk right past them and find my son. Nobody stopped me and said, ‘Julie, there has been a bit of an accident’.

“I got there and I put my arm around him and gave him a kiss on the head. Then I thought, ‘What is all that round his neck? All this white stuff’.

“When I pulled the gown down, I could see he had really nasty burns, all bubbled up.”

Tyler had burns from his right shoulder to his chin as well as on his back and face, which had been treated with Sudocrem. There was also bruising on both Tyler’s arms.

Ms Maxx said: “He was in shock. He didn’t smile at me like he normally does. He’d been really happy to see me when I had gone before but there was no smile this time. He must have been in agony.”

She said she was angry when she saw the burns and bruises and shouted, “What has happened to my son” but was not offered an explanation.

Despite his condition, Tyler was still taken to the John Radcliffe by ambulance for assessment.

Nurses there cleaned and dressed the burns and Ms Maxx said one nurse was shocked at the extent of the injuries. The assessment confirmed that surgery would be too dangerous and Tyler was taken back to the Royal Berks.

Ms Maxx said leaving Tyler that evening made her feel like “the worst mother on earth”.

She said: “I hated leaving my son there. Inside I was still full of rage and hurt and I was devastated at what had happened to him.

“I was sitting there just wanting to pick him up and take him home but I had to leave him there on the ward where this had happened.”

Ms Maxx filed a complaint with the hospital and called the police once she got home.

On August 22 she gave a statement to detectives and showed them pictures of Tyler’s injuries.

The police have since confirmed they are not investigating and have referred the issue to the hospital.

Tyler was placed in Sidmouth Ward but has since been transferred to the respiratory ward after testing positive for covid-19 last week.

Ms Maxx said she had spoken to director of nursing Jessica Higson and renal matron Angela Clarke and was confident the hospital was taking her complaint seriously.

She said: “I am absolutely sick to death of disabled people having accidents when they are in other people’s care.

“This is 2022 and the world needs to finally wake up to disabled people. They are still human beings, they’re just wired differently. They still have feelings like the rest of us.

“In the hospital, I feel my son was neglected because they didn’t know how to deal with him. I thought I’d put him somewhere safe.

“I’ve had quite a few apologies from people at the hospital but it’s not enough. They need to learn from this. This is serious.

“It should never have happened and should never ever happen again.”

Sally Moore, head of communications and engagement at Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: “We are sorry Tyler sustained these currently unexplained injuries to his neck, shoulder and arm and we are working with our colleagues, including the police and social care, to investigate all the

circumstances.

“Our director of nursing has spoken to Ms Maxx and reassured her that we will continue to work with her to establish what happened.

“We have also assured her that our staff are dedicated to providing the best possible care to our patients and ensuring their families and carers are fully informed and involved in their treatment at all times.

“Our investigation will include a review of the engagement between Ms Maxx and our staff to see if we can make any further improvements.”

"A MOTHER is furious that her severely disabled son was injured while being treated in hospital.

Julie Maxx, 56, said an apology was not enough after she found her son Tyler, 24, with burns on his neck, shoulder and face as well as bruising on both arms while visiting him at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.

She claims staff at the Reading hospital showed a lack of care and understanding towards her son, who was born with brain damage, severe learning disabilities and cerebral palsy.

The Royal Berkshire Foundation Trust says it is investigating the “unexplained” injuries. Tyler, who is nicknamed “Tyler smiler” for his infectious grin, was being treated for a snapped titanium rod in his spine when Ms Maxx discovered his injuries on August 12, just over a month after he had been admitted.

Tyler lives in a flat below his mother in Gainsborough Crescent, Henley, and regularly attends the Chiltern Centre, a respite centre for disabled young adults off Greys Road. On July 3 he began suffering nosebleeds and chronic seizures and was experiencing intense pain when he moved.

Ms Maxx, who is her son’s full-time carer, believed he had a chest infection and after a week without any sign of improvement called paramedics who took him to the emergency department at the Royal Berks.

The 54-bed specialist service, in Boxted Road, provides assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for men with learning disabilities.

The facility also provides assistance and support to those with autism spectrum disorders or mental health needs.

The ‘good’ rated institution is now looking to hire more support workers to fill a number of vacancies – something which is proving difficult for the entire care sector.

During the open day current staff members will speak about how jobseekers can make a difference to the lives of people with severe and enduring mental illness.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

The open day will take place on October 7 from 10am until 4pm.

Ron Gutu, operations director for Cygnet Hospital Colchester, said: “Locally we have had to deal with a shortage of support workers which has also been reflected nationally.

While we do have enough staff to deliver safe care, increased demand for specialist services like ours means it is crucial to recruit talented and compassionate individuals to help reduce the current pressure on the sector.

“Previous experience is not essential, but it is important that applicants have a passion for delivering outstanding care and helping others.

“Many of our most dedicated staff members started out as support workers and they will be on hand to share their experiences at the open day for people interested in a career in care.”

The open day will take place on October 7 from 10am until 4pm.

"Devon’s crime tsar has welcomed the addition of X-ray body scanners at Exeter Prison in a bid to crack down on smuggling of drugs, phones and weapons.

The city centre slammer is one of 16 across the of the country in line to be fitted with the contraband-busting high-tech machines.

They are expected to be installed at the New North Road lock-up by the summer.

Images produced by the scanner provide a level of detail inside the body that has not been seen before in the Prison Service.

Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez has haled the ‘fantastic news’.

In tests at HMP Leeds, the technology found more than 300 smuggled items and, in its first year, has slashed the number of drugs getting into the prison.

The use of X-ray body scanners at 10 other challenging prisons was successful in detecting contraband and contributed to a significant reduction in violence and drug use.

“This is fantastic news,” said Ms Hernandez. “I wrote to the previous Minister to prioritise HMP Exeter due to the levels of violence and drug-taking.

“Drugs are rife in British prisons, criminality is allowed to flourish, and gangs exploit fundamental weaknesses in security to carry out their illegal activity.

“Ex-offenders will stand a much better chance of leading fulfilling and productive lives if they have experienced rehabilitation and support while in the care of the Prison Service.”

She added: “HMP Exeter is a remand prison, which means a high turnover of inmates and more opportunities to smuggle.

“Drugs and smuggled phones cause all sorts of problems and tensions inside prisons.

“I hope that here in the Westcountry we will soon be seeing the benefits of this technology for inmates, their families, prison staff and wider society.

“It does not make any sense to any of us that prisoners sometimes have access to drugs in what should be the safest environment possible.”",ID_26,Exeter Prison,Exeter,East Devon,eastdevonnews.co.uk,article-661321

"Dr Pam Chrispin, from Diss, is retiring from the EAAA after 14 years with the life-saving charity and a 40- year medical career.

To mark her retirement, the charity sent the 62-year-old on a surprise treasure hunt across Norfolk where she was reunited with patients, old friends and colleagues who she had helped over the years.

Among them was nine-year-old Tilly who Dr Chrispin cared for four years ago when the then five-year-old suffered a life-threatening asthma attack.

Along with the EAAA team, they were able to stabilise Tilly and get her safely to hospital where she received treatment.

Speaking at the NARS HQ in Dereham, Hayley, Tilly’s mum, said: “Without Pam’s involvement in Tilly’s care that day she might not be here now. We’re forever thankful to her and the rest of the EAAA team.”

At the end of the treasure hunt, back at the EAAA base in Norwich, Dr Chrispin was also reunited with a mother and child she helped to save in 2018.

Emma Cavanagh, from Royston, was 37 weeks pregnant with Willow, now three, when she suffered a serious complication putting both of their lives at risk.

But after Dr Chrispin’s quick diagnosis, the mum was rushed to hospital where she underwent major surgery.

Ms Cavanagh added: ""She’s our absolute hero. If it wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t be here today. I wouldn’t have a precious family. She means the absolute world to us. We feel so honoured that we’ve been asked to be here today for her retirement.”

As well as helping to save countless lives, during her career Dr Chrispin was able to “kick the door down for women” after she became the EAAA’s first ever female flying doctor in 2007.

In 2016, she was also one of the first doctors to be formally employed by EAAA and in 2018 she became the charity's first Deputy Medical Director - a title she will hold until her retirement on January 31.

Dr Chrispin specialised as an anaesthetist and has sat on several medical boards across the region including with the East of England Ambulance Service (medical director 2010 to 2013), West Suffolk Hospital (medical director 2014 to 2016) and continues to be a Non-Executive Director at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for Safeguarding, Maternity and Children and Young People.

She said: “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with EAAA, proving that a small middle-aged woman in glasses could do this job back in 2007 when it was, at the time, a job mainly carried out by men.

"Dr Pam Chrispin, from Diss, is retiring from the EAAA after 14 years with the life-saving charity and a 40- year medical career.

To mark her retirement, the charity sent the 62-year-old on a surprise treasure hunt across Norfolk where she was reunited with patients, old friends and colleagues who she had helped over the years.

Among them was nine-year-old Tilly who Dr Chrispin cared for four years ago when the then five-year-old suffered a life-threatening asthma attack.

Along with the EAAA team, they were able to stabilise Tilly and get her safely to hospital where she received treatment.

Speaking at the NARS HQ in Dereham, Hayley, Tilly’s mum, said: “Without Pam’s involvement in Tilly’s care that day she might not be here now. We’re forever thankful to her and the rest of the EAAA team.”

At the end of the treasure hunt, back at the EAAA base in Norwich, Dr Chrispin was also reunited with a mother and child she helped to save in 2018.

Emma Cavanagh, from Royston, was 37 weeks pregnant with Willow, now three, when she suffered a serious complication putting both of their lives at risk.

But after Dr Chrispin’s quick diagnosis, the mum was rushed to hospital where she underwent major surgery.

Ms Cavanagh added: ""She’s our absolute hero. If it wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t be here today. I wouldn’t have a precious family. She means the absolute world to us. We feel so honoured that we’ve been asked to be here today for her retirement.”

As well as helping to save countless lives, during her career Dr Chrispin was able to “kick the door down for women” after she became the EAAA’s first ever female flying doctor in 2007.

"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",ID_29,Bath,Bath and North East Somerset,"Bristol, City of",bristolpost.co.uk,article-690497

All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",ID_29,Saltford,Bath and North East Somerset,"Bristol, City of",bristolpost.co.uk,article-690497
"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.

"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.

“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.

"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”
The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.

The idea of congestion charges were popular in last year's JLTP4 consultation.
What new infrastructure is proposed?
Mass transit
The JLTP4 says a mass transit network could dramatically improve journey times across the Bristol and Bath urban areas, and take passengers from central Bristol to Bristol Airport within 15 minutes.
The network will be complemented by metrobus, the new bus network in Bristol.
The JLTP4 says a mass transit system for Bath is part of the solution to reduce congestion, ease traffic pollution and re-energise the economy.
“Through further detailed technical work, the major role trams could play in helping to meet the future growth and transport needs of the city, and improved connectivity with Bristol, will be established.""
All key routes within Bath will be considered, including:
– A367 Odd Down
– Newbridge - either along the A4 or A36 integrating with the new rapid transit corridor between bath and Bristol
– Lansdown from the north of Bath
– A4 from the east of Bath.
Bath Trams spokesman David Andrews commended metro mayor Tim Bowles for including trams in the plan as an alternative to rubber-tyred buses.
But he said it was a pity a metrobus extension was being mooted between Bath and Keynsham, saying it had been “well proven that buses cannot attract car drivers out of their cars, whereas trams can”.
Many of the buses across the region, including metrobus, are run by First West of England. Managing director James Freeman said: “If we are to maintain the quality of life in Bath and North East Somerset, we are going to need some decisive action to tackle to appalling congestion that is more and more blighting not just the city of Bath but the whole area.
“This will need more priority devoted to public transport on the street, coupled with the encouragement of walking and yes, even in Bath, cycling.
“We welcome the stated desire to see the development of a rapid transit system not just between Bath and Bristol along the A4 corridor but also within the city.
“While there may well be ambitions for rail-based solutions on the street, buses can actually meet these needs perfectly well as long as they have proper priority. This plan points the way towards some radical solutions and we welcome it.”
Transport campaigner Dave Redgewell said the plan had too little emphasis on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport.
New roads
Chief among the new roads proposed for Bath and North East Somerset is the South East Bristol Orbital Corridor, which would connect the A4 to the A37.
Its inclusion has sparked disappointment from campaigners who rallied against it.
South Bristol Wrong Road founder Faye Dicker said the 1,600 people who objected in the JLTP consultation “were not being listened to”.
She said: “At a time of a climate emergency, it is a backwards step to destroy valuable green belt and build more roads. We all know, more roads, bring more traffic.
“We want to see an end to the whole ring road concept through green fields at enormous cost in financial and community terms.”
Ms Dicker said the next JLTP should bring radical changes to mass transit, through light rail and the use of trams powered by green energy, along with better walking and cycling options.
The plan says: “There is poor infrastructure and public transport service facilitating orbital movements around south east Bristol and the surrounding area.
“The lack of any orbital connection is forcing people to drive along the A4 and use unsuitable local roads in residential areas. This adds more traffic to the already heavily congested A4.
“This is preventing us from reallocating road space to transformational and sustainable modes such as Mass Transit and other low carbon travel options.
“Comments received through the JLTP consultation raised concerns that residents felt that plans are well developed, however only initial modelling options have been assessed at this stage and we have much more to do, in consultation with the local community, to develop the plans and any future infrastructure solutions further.”
The JLTP also refers to a new Saltford bypass, but further work will be done to assess options for bus priority on the approaches to the village before a decision is made.
New train stations will be considered at Saltford, along with Charfield, St Annes Park, Saltford, Ashton Gate and Constable Road, and there could be new rail links to Thornbury, Pilning and Bristol Airport.
Saltford station is described in the plan as an “early investment schemes under development”.
Park and rides
The JLTP4 says: “We support the concept of a ring of park and ride locations around the urban areas, to help tackle traffic and air quality problems in central areas.
“In Bath, the priority is to intercept traffic on the A4 corridor to the east of the city.
“We will promote further expansion and improvement of the existing park and ride sites at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
“We will deliver the Freezing Hill junction upgrade and improvements at two other junctions along the route between the A420 and Lansdown park and ride.”
A new park and ride could be built in Whitchurch, and another is being mooted south of Hicks Gate junction to replace the existing Brislington park and ride.
“Completion of a continuous and integrated network of strategic cycle routes, comprising key corridors and cross city routes, complemented by improved permeability and investment in public realm in the city centre.
“This network will connect key destinations across the Bath urban area.
“Local routes will be improved and integrated into the strategic network as part of ongoing programmes.
“Bath city centre is in a natural ‘bowl’ with steep slopes into the city centre from the north and south.
“This is likely to constrain the attractiveness of cycling from the north and south, and the primary opportunities will be on east-west corridors in the city.”",ID_29,Freezing Hill,South Gloucestershire,"Bristol, City of",bristolpost.co.uk,article-690497
"Drivers entering Bath could one day have to pay a congestion charge - on top of the clean air zone bill that will be levied on many dirty vehicles.
Paying to park at work and council tax hikes are also being considered to plug a £6billion black hole in funding for new infrastructure across the region.
The West of England’s new joint local transport plan (JLTP4) says upgrades of existing road and rail networks and a slew of new schemes are essential to make the region carbon neutral by 2030.
The 20-year wishlist calls for better public transport between Bristol and Bath, a new railway station at Saltford, a new park and ride on the east of Bath, and improvements to walking and cycling.
But it is unclear how much of it is deliverable.
The total cost will be £8.9billion, or up to £600million a year. The previous plan saw £500million spent on infrastructure in seven years, which is itself described as a significant achievement.
The JLTP4 says the investment is necessary to cut car use, but will require a “step change” in funding to provide transformational infrastructure and it is unrealistic to assume central government will plug the £6billion gap.
Options for securing the necessary funding include congestion charges to drive into specific areas, using income from clean air zone charges, a workplace parking levy and increasing council tax.
Bath and Bristol are both introducing clean air zone charges to cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the cities, with daily fees for the worst polluting vehicles - but not cars.
The JLTP4 says: “The introduction of charging mechanisms, such as road pricing covering the Bristol and Bath urban areas, would raise a significant amount of revenue.
“This would help fill the funding gap and raise revenue for infrastructure delivery, but would be extremely challenging to deliver.
“Phasing will need to be considered carefully in order to ensure that effective alternatives to private car use are implemented in tandem with the roll-out of any charging mechanism.”

The duo missed the 3-0 defeat at Dagenham and Redbridge last Saturday with a sore knee and a sore shoulder respectively.

Their return may be offset by injury problems elsewhere in Pete Wild’s squad though.

“We’re hoping Hyde’s going to train on Thursday. He did his running on Tuesday and passed all his markers,” Wild said.

“So we’re hoping he’ll train on Thursday, along with Allen.

“But we’ve picked up two or three knocks against Dagenham, and we’re assessing those.

“Fair play to the lads, they’re rolling themselves out when they’ve got knocks and bumps, carrying on when they’re injured, so fair play to them.

“We’ve got to try and look after the group as best we can.”

Wild says The Shaymen still believe they can finish in the play-offs.

Halifax are 10th in the table, one point off seventh, but Eastleigh, who are level on points with Town, have a game in hand.

The Shaymen realistically need to win both games to have a chance, and will be relying on sides above them to drop points.

Wild’s men have lost back-to-back games against Boreham Wood and Dagenham and Redbridge, and visit Maidenhead on Saturday.

“Of course we can, we can still do it,” Wild said.

“We’ll have to work hard to get results, but we certainly can and we still believe we can.

“We’ve sat down and had a chat as a group and we firmly believe we can do it.

“We’ve had another excellent season and we want to finish off in style. We haven’t worked for 10 months to throw it away at the end, so we firmly think we can do it.”

When asked what his side need to do better against Maidenhead, the Town manager said: “Play for longer. Watching the (Dagenham) video back, we were brilliant for the first 25 minutes, we played really well.

“But we need to do that for sustained periods of time, we need to take our chances when they come.

“Looking back at the (Dagenham) game, they’ve only opened us up twice in general play, and two of their goals have come from set-pieces, one on the counter, so we need to defend against set-pieces better and make sure they can’t drive through us.

“So there’s bits. It wasn’t a complete disaster, but we certainly need to play better for longer.”

The Shaymen have won four and lost four of their last eight games, seeing them drop out of the top seven from a position where a play-off place looked on the cards, to it now hanging in the balance.

“It’s frustrating for us all, we’re all desperate to do well,” Wild said. “If we’d had that consistency we’d have been home and hosed by now, but the truth of the matter is we’re not.

“Like I said on Saturday, when you’re down four players and we’ve got players on the pitch carrying injuries that are just trying to get through the game, that’s unfortunately where we are as a football club because of the strength-in-depth that we have within the squad.”

Maidenhead drew 0-0 at Yeovil on Tuesday night, leaving them 14th in the table after one win in their last seven matches.

"FUNDING from the Housing Executive has encouraged some Mid-Ulster residents to get more green-fingered in the garden.

Allocating £1,300.14 to Tamnamore Community Development Association, the Housing Executive awarded the funds through its Community Grant Scheme.

Tamnamore Community Development Association used these funds to encourage local tenants and residents to take pride in their gardens and community, with displays of vegetables and flowers.

They are also hoping to create a green group for garden enthusiasts, which will allow local residents to come together and share their knowledge of green spaces and gardens.

"A banned driver caught behind the wheel claimed he was unaware of the disqualification.

Declan Simper, 24, said correspondence relating to his ban as a totter must have gone to a previous address.

He was pulled over by police in Wisbech Road, South Lynn, on February 2, town magistrates were told on Thursday.

King's Lynn Magistrates' Court (58166673)

Checks showed he was banned and Simper told officers it was a “genuine mistake”, said prosecutor Jodin Gherra.

“The defendant admitted that he knew he had between six and 12 points on his licence and points pending,” she told the bench.

The court heard that Simper had been disqualified in January for eight months.

Simper, formerly of Wisbech Road, South Lynn, and now living in Railway Lane South, Sutton Bridge, pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and not having insurance.

Solicitor George Sorrell, mitigating, said: “He’s adamant that all correspondence was sent to his old address in Kirkham Lane, Wisbech, and he didn’t get it.”

He added that his client, who is a carer for his father in Clenchwarton, had lost his job as a valeter as a result of the ban coming to light.

Simper’s sentence effectively increased his ban by three months.

He was also fined £120 and ordered to pay £84 in costs and victim surcharge.

""Sam made so many good memories with everyone and such a shame he no longer can. Sam made a huge impact on so many lives and will be a huge miss.""
Emergency services were called to Park Avenue, in the Silksworth area of Sunderland, shortly after 1am on Friday after being alerted to reports of an assault by the ambulance service.
Sam was found seriously injured with wounds police have described as ""consistent with a stabbing"".
Despite attempts to save his life, he died at the scene.
Staff at the Gatsby pub, on Derwent Street, in Sunderland, have also paid tribute to him.
In a Facebook post, they said: “We are all laden with grief that Sam won’t be behind the bar to bring us the laughter and happiness he so often did. Big Sam and his 6ft 6in stature was always the biggest presence in the room. He cared deeply for his friends and colleagues.
“He possessed many admirable qualities that made him an exemplary member of the team and above all a fierce friend. We will miss this unreserved gentleman so much.

"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

The documents include details of:

• Better access to existing jobs for Gravesham, Thurrock and Havering as improved journey times would bring over 400,000 more jobs within a 60-minute commute, when the new crossing is open for traffic

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.

• Two new public parks that would remove the need for over 470,000 HGV movements on local roads by beneficially reusing excavated material:

• Chalk Park: a 38-hectare park near Gravesend

• Tilbury Fields: a 48-hectare park overlooking the Thames in Thurrock

• Over 260 hectares of new woodland – in addition to the new 100-hectare community woodland being created in partnership with Forestry England, near Great Warley in Brentwood

• 46km of new and improved footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes, as well as 120% more hedgerows, 40% more ponds, 10% more ditches, and seven new green bridges

• The proposed locations of the construction and utility compounds, and temporary construction roads

• A summary of the predicted impact of the project during construction and operation on topics ranging from local traffic, public transport and cycle paths to air quality, noise and vibration.

Matt Palmer, executive director for the project, said: “The Lower Thames Crossing is the most ambitious road scheme in a generation.

A new bridge will be set up over the M25

“The new, reliable connection would improve access to hundreds of thousands of additional jobs, offer new opportunities for local businesses, and create and connect new green spaces that are so important for wildlife and local communities.

“The feedback has been crucial in helping us design a scheme that brings the most benefit to local communities while reducing its impact.

“This further consultation is another opportunity for people to have their say before we submit our planning application at the end of the year.

“I would like to thank everyone in advance for once again giving us their time and feedback.”

Highways England says the new tunnel would help ease congestion and air quality on the Dartford Crossing by diverting more than 13 million vehicles away every year.

Bosses also claim it would create jobs for up to 22,000 people during construction. Highways England says it will analyse the responses from the latest consultation before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) later this year.

The consent process can take up to 18 months and if given the green light, construction is expected to start in 2024 with the road opening between 2029 and 2030.

"Highways England has launched a new public consultation today on its plans to build a tunnel under the River Thames to connect south Essex with Kent.

The eight-week consultation gives the public the opportunity to have their say on the project and its impact on the community and environment. Highways England says changes have been made to the project since the last consultation in 2020.

The changes have been published in a new online document which is available via a website which also features new images of the proposed road, three new fly-throughs showing it before, during and after construction, and an updated interactive map.

"Hughie Higginson, from Burnley, was surprised with the tickets live on radio to celebrate both his 12th birthday and also in recognition of the fundraising he has undertaken for cancer charities.

Hughie and his dad, Keiron, attended Gallagher’s intimate charity gig which took place at Blackburn’s King George’s Hall last night.

Hughie Higginson at King George's Hall to see Liam Gallagher

They were two of just 2,200 lucky people who were able to get tickets, which were allocated via a random ballot.

Hughie, who is a pupil at Ribblesdale High School in Clitheroe, said he was “shocked” to be given the news and was the envy of his school friends.

He said: “When I told my school friends I had been on the radio and going to see Liam Gallagher they were like ‘are you actually? You are well lucky’

“I think they were a bit jealous.”

Hughie Higginson at King George's Hall to see Liam Gallagher

Liam announced performed the surprise gig to celebrate his latest collaboration with Darwen trainer designer Gary Aspden and also to raise vital funds for Blackburn homeless charity, Nightsafe.

Speaking about the gig, Hughie said: “It was such a fantastic night.

“Because it was such a small space with not many people the atmosphere was great.”

His favourite songs from the set were either Wonderwall or Wall of Glass.

Hughie said it was “up there” with one of his best birthdays.

He said: “It was definitely up there with one of my best birthdays and one I will never forget.

“It was fairly close to last year’s as we found out that we had won the Pride of Manchester award.”

Hughie said he has been a fan of the former Oasis frontman since the age of four and has even performed one of his songs at a theatre school, aged seven.

Hughie’s 12th birthday today and he’s just had the biggest surprise from @GrahamLiver live on @BBCLancashire he’s off to see @liamgallagher tonight!!

Dad Keiron said: “I like Oasis and listen to their songs in the car. Hughie has his own taste in music as well but he’s definitely a Liam fan.”

Keiron wanted to praise Liam for taking the time to play in Blackburn.

He said: “For Liam Gallagher to put his time aside for Nightsafe charity shows what a kid hearted guy he is.

“The support band, The Illicits were really good as well. It was great to see some local lads performing so well.”

Hughie was diagnosed with ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) in 2020 and began urgent treatment at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.

Hughie, along with his friend, Freddie Xavi, has raised hundreds of thousands for charity over the last two years.

In 2021, they were even given a Pride of Britain award for raising more than £200,000 Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital Charity and were announced as Good Morning Britain Young Fundraisers.

He said: “It was definitely up there with one of my best birthdays and one I will never forget.

“It was fairly close to last year’s as we found out that we had won the Pride of Manchester award.”

Hughie said he has been a fan of the former Oasis frontman since the age of four and has even performed one of his songs at a theatre school, aged seven.

“The support band, The Illicits were really good as well. It was great to see some local lads performing so well.”

Hughie was diagnosed with ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) in 2020 and began urgent treatment at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.

Hughie, along with his friend, Freddie Xavi, has raised hundreds of thousands for charity over the last two years.

In 2021, they were even given a Pride of Britain award for raising more than £200,000 Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital Charity and were announced as Good Morning Britain Young Fundraisers.

They are currently undertaking a running challenge together which will see them tour the UK to run 1km around 92 Premier League and English Football League clubs, raising money for Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital Charity as well as other oncology wards around the country.",ID_37,King George’s Hall,Cotswold,Blackburn with Darwen,lancashiretelegraph.co.uk,article-953444
"Hughie Higginson, from Burnley, was surprised with the tickets live on radio to celebrate both his 12th birthday and also in recognition of the fundraising he has undertaken for cancer charities.

They were two of just 2,200 lucky people who were able to get tickets, which were allocated via a random ballot.

Hughie, who is a pupil at Ribblesdale High School in Clitheroe, said he was “shocked” to be given the news and was the envy of his school friends.

He said: “When I told my school friends I had been on the radio and going to see Liam Gallagher they were like ‘are you actually? You are well lucky’

“I think they were a bit jealous.”
